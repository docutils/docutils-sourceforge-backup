To Do
=====

- set up CVS on SF!

- implement a parser according to the markup implementation plan

- create a standalone reStructuredText -> HTML/XML converter (stdin ->
  stdout filter)

- allow very long titles (on two or more lines)?

- interpret RCS keywords in field lists? ``$keyword: value$`` could be
  interpreted as ``keyword: value``; ``$keyword$`` could be
  interpreted as ``keyword:`` (no value).


Enumerated Lists
================

(A future revision of this specification may allow for compound
enumerators, such as '1.a.' or '1(a)', to allow for nested enumerated
lists without indentation.)


Literal Blocks
==============

[Aside: One possible variation is for meta-documentation (perhaps an
extension?): use triple-colons (':::') or a directive ('..
literal-parsed::') to indicate 'take the following literal block, mark
it up as a literal block, then copy it and mark it up as if it weren't
a literal block'.  The implementation may insert text in-between, such
as 'Marked up as:', or may alter the formatting (different font, set
in a colored box, whatever).]


Indentation of List Items
=========================

Perhaps the indentation shouldn't be so strict. Currently, this is
required::

    1. First line,
       second line.

Anything wrong with this? ::

    1. First line,
     second line.

Especially for option lists & field lists, this could be handy::

    --longopt  Description,
               second line.
    --verylongopt  Description,
               second line.
    --very_long_option_name, --another_long_option, -s
               Description,
               second line.

(Currently, the second option's second line has to be lined up with
the first; and the third option would be very difficult indeed.)

Problem?

    1. First para.

       Block quote. (no good: requires some indent relative to first
       para)

     Second Para.

    2. Have to carefully define where the literal block ends::

         Literal block

       Literal block?

Hmm... Non-strict indentation isn't such a good idea.

Another approach: Going back to the first draft of reStructuredText
(2000-11-27 post to Doc-SIG):

    - This is the fourth item of the main list (no blank line above).
    The second line of this item is not indented relative to the
    bullet, which precludes it from having a second paragraph.

Change that to *require* a blank line above and below, to reduce
ambiguity. This "loosening" may be added later, once the parser's
been nailed down.


Horizontal Rules
================

Wolfgang Lipp suggested adding horizontal rules (HTML <HR>) to the
syntax.  A line of punctuation with a blank line before and after::

    Para.

    ------------------------------------------------------------

    Para.

The problem is, HRs are purely presentational.  What structural
significance do they have?


Parser Notes
============

- What should incorrect indentation do? E.g.::

      Here is a paragraph.

              Indent 8 spaces.

          Indent 4 spaces.

  As is, this generates a <block_quote><block_quote></></>. Should
  this trigger a warning?
