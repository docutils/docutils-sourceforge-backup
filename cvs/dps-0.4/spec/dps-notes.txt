To Do
=====

- Complete PEP 258 DPS Generic Implementation Details.

  - Fill in the blanks in API details.

  - Specify the nodes.py internal data structure implementation.

        [Tibs:] Eventually we need to have direct documentation in
        there on how it all hangs together - the DTD is not enough
        (indeed, is it still meant to be correct?  [Yes, it is.]).

- Rework PEP 257, separating style from spec from tools, wrt DPS?  See
  Doc-SIG from 2001-06-19/20.

- Document!

  - Modules.

  - DPS nodes (DTD element) semantics:

    - External (public) attributes (node.attributes).
    - Internal attributes (node.*).
    - Linking mechanism.

- Get cracking on the DPS itself!

- Add layout component to framework?  Or part of the formatter?

- Add validation?  See http://pytrex.sourceforge.net, RELAX NG.

- Write modules for common transforms.  See `Unimplemented
  Transforms`_ below.

- Ask Python-dev for opinions (GvR for a pronouncement) on special
  variables (__author__, __version__, etc.): convenience vs. namespace
  pollution.  Ask opinions on whether or not the DPS should recognize
  & use them.

- Once doctree.txt is fleshed out, how about breaking (most of) it up
  and putting it into nodes.py as docstrings?

- Refactor:

  - Apply the `coding conventions`_ as given below.

- Merge reStructuredText into DPS and rename it to "docutils".
  (SourceForge project registered & waiting.)

  - Merge test directories.
  - Remove complex import code.
  - Rename gpdi.dtd to docutils.dtd.
  - Rename writers/html.py to html4_css1.py.  With aliases?

- Provide a mechanism to pass options to Readers, Writers, and Parsers
  through dps.core.publish/Publisher?  Or create custom
  Reader/Writer/Parser objects first, and pass *them* to
  publish/Publisher?

- In reader.get_reader_class (& parser & writer too), should we be
  importing 'standalone' or 'dps.readers.standalone'?  (This would
  avoid importing top-level modules if the module name is not in
  dps/readers.  Potential nastiness.)

- Perhaps store a name->id mapping file?  This could be stored
  permanently, read by subsequent processing runs, and updated with
  new entries.  ("Persistent ID mapping"?)

- The name->id conversion and hyperlink resolution code needs to be
  checked for correctness and refactored.  I'm afraid it's a bit of a
  spaghetti mess now.

- Considerations for an HTML Writer [#]_:

  - Boolean attributes.  ``<element boolean>`` is good, ``<element
    boolean="boolean">`` is bad.  Use a special value in attribute
    mappings, such as ``None``?

  - Escape double-dashes inside comments.

  - Put the language code into an appropriate element's LANG
    attribute (<HTML>?).

  - Docutils identifiers (the "class" and "id" attributes) will
    conform to the regular expression ``[a-z][-a-z0-9]*``.  See
    ``docutils.utils.id()``.

  .. [#] Source: `HTML 4.0 in Netscape and Explorer`__.

- Allow for style sheet info to be passed in, either as a <LINK>, or
  as embedded style info.

- Construct a templating system, as in ht2html/yaptu, using directives
  and substitutions for dynamic stuff.

- Improve the granularity of document parts in the HTML writer, so
  that one could just grab the parts needed.


Coding Conventions
==================

This project shall follow the generic coding conventions as specified
in the `Style Guide for Python Code`__ and `Docstring Conventions`__
PEPs, with the following clarifications:

- 4 spaces per indentation level.  No tabs.
- No one-liner compound statements (i.e., no ``if x: return``: use two
  lines & indentation), except for degenerate class or method
  definitions (i.e., ``class X: pass`` is O.K.).
- Lines should be no more than 78 or 79 characters long.
- "CamelCase" shall be used for class names.
- Use "lowercase" or "lowercase_with_underscores" for function,
  method, and variable names.  For short names, maximum two joined
  words, use lowercase (e.g. 'tagname').  For long names with three or
  more joined words, or where it's hard to parse the split between two
  words, use lowercase_with_underscores (e.g., 'note_explicit_target',
  'explicit_target').

Unimplemented Transforms
========================

Footnote Gathering
------------------

Collect and move footnotes to the end of a document.


Hyperlink Target Gathering
--------------------------

It probably comes in two phases, because in a Python context we need
to *resolve* them on a per-docstring basis [do we? --DG], but if the
user is trying to do the callout form of presentation, they would then
want to group them all at the end of the document.


Reference Merging
-----------------

When merging two or more subdocuments (such as docstrings),
conflicting references may need to be resolved.  There may be:

- duplicate reference and/or substitution names that need to be made
  unique; and/or
- duplicate footnote numbers that need to be renumbered.

Should this be done before or after reference-resolving transforms
are applied?  What about references from within one subdocument to
inside another?


Document Splitting
------------------

If the processed document is written to multiple files (possibly in a
directory tree), it will need to be split up.  References will have to
be adjusted.

(HTML only?  See Distributors_ below.)


Navigation
----------

If a document is split up, each segment will need navigation links:
parent, children (small TOC), previous (preorder), next (preorder).


Index
-----

@@@


I/O APIs
========

Can we use codecs for this?  Input to parser and output from formatter
are strings, but the intermediate data structure is a DOM tree.


Docstring Extractor
===================

We need code that scans a parsed Python module, and returns an ordered
tree containing the names, docstrings (including attribute and
additional docstrings), and additional info (in parentheses below) of
all of the following objects:

- packages
- modules
- module attributes (+ values)
- classes (+ inheritance)
- class attributes (+ values)
- instance attributes (+ values)
- methods (+ formal parameters & defaults)
- functions (+ formal parameters & defaults)

(Extract comments too?  For example, comments at the start of a module
would be a good place for bibliographic field lists.)

In order to evaluate interpreted text cross-references, namespaces for
each of the above will also be required.

See python-dev/docstring-develop thread "AST mining", started on
2001-08-14.


Python Source Reader
====================

The Python Source Reader ("PySource") model that's evolving in my mind
goes something like this:

1. Extract the docstring/namespace [#]_ tree from the module(s) and/or
   package(s).

   .. [#] See `Docstring Extractor`_ above.

2. Run the parser on each docstring in turn, producing a forest of
   doctrees (per nodes.py).

3. Join the docstring trees together into a single tree, running
   transforms:

   - merge hyperlinks
   - merge namespaces
   - create various sections like "Module Attributes", "Functions",
     "Classes", "Class Attributes", etc.; see the DPS spec/ppdi.dtd
   - convert the above special sections to ordinary DPS nodes

4. Run transforms on the combined doctree.  Examples: resolving
   cross-references/hyperlinks (including interpreted text on Python
   identifiers); footnote auto-numbering; first field list ->
   bibliographic elements.

   (Or should step 4's transforms come before step 3?)

5. Pass the resulting unified tree to the writer/builder.

I've had trouble reconciling the roles of input parser and output
writer with the idea of modes ("readers" or "directors").  Does the
mode govern the tranformation of the input, the output, or both?
Perhaps the mode should be split into two.

For example, say the source of our input is a Python module.  Our
"input mode" should be the "Python Source Reader".  It discovers (from
``__docformat__``) that the input parser is "reStructuredText".  If we
want HTML, we'll specify the "HTML" output formatter.  But there's a
piece missing.  What *kind* or *style* of HTML output do we want?
PyDoc-style, LibRefMan style, etc.  (many people will want to specify
and control their own style).  Is the output style specific to a
particular output format (XML, HTML, etc.)?  Is the style specific to
the input mode?  Or can/should they be independent?

I envision interaction between the input parser, an "input mode" , and
the output formatter.  The same intermediate data format would be used
between each of these, being transformed as it progresses.
