Rrefactor-test
==============

The ``Rrefactor-test`` branch is being used by Garth to try out a major 
re-structuring of the reStructuredText unit tests. Working on such an 
update in ``MAIN`` or ``rel-0-3`` would be downright impolite, hence the 
branch. 

Changes made in ``Rrefactor-test`` will be merged into ``MAIN`` when, and 
if, the following occur: 

* Garth starts his work. 
* Garth finishes his work. 
* David is persuaded that Garth's changes are useful.
