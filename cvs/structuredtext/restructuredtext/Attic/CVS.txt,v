This document describes the code line management standards for
reStructuredText and, potentially, the docstring processing system.

**Contents:**
  * `Release Life Cycle`_ 
  * `Background`_

Instructions for accessing the reStructuredText repository can be
found on Sourceforge:

Release Life Cycle
------------------

Major Releases
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* New major releases begin life as *named project branches* branched
  off HEAD::

    cvs rtag -r HEAD -b Rprojectname modulename
    
  We use ``rtag`` because it works direct from the repository,
  ignoring whatever you're currently up to in your working directory.

* *Numbered release branches* are made from the named project branch
  when the project resembles a finished product and an intended
  version number is decided::

    cvs rtag -r Rprojectname -b rel-2-0 modulename
    cvs update -r Rrel-2-0
    
  This is when to change the version numbers in various text files and
  in the ``__version__`` string in ``__init__.py``. Don't forget to
  commit the changes and propagate them back! 
  
* A minimum of changes -- traditionally, bug fixes only -- is made to
  the numbered release branch. All changes should be merged back into
  the named project branch.

* When the release is ready, the tag
  ``rel-<major>-<minor>-<patchnumber>-RELEASE`` is applied to the files
  in the numbered release branch::

    cvs rtag -r rel-2-0 rel-2-0-RELEASE modulename

* The appropriate release CURRENT tag is also applied:

    cvs rtag -r rel-2-0-RELEASE rel-2-0-CURRENT modulename

* After a quick final check, the release archive should be built from
  the RELEASE tag::

    cvs update -r rel-2-0-RELEASE
    <execute commands to build archive>

* Finally, any changes made in the release that haven't already been
  merged into HEAD should be so merged. 

Minor Releases
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* New minor releases should begin life as named project branches off
  the *project branch* for the associated major release::

    cvs rtag -r Rprojectname -b Rprojectname.1 modulename

  Using the project branch as a basis permits starting new minor
  releases well before the major release branch is created, necessary
  when a middling sized feature has to be bumped from the major. To be
  consistent, therefore, we should only ever do it this way. 

* The naming convention shall begin at 
  ``Rmajorbranchprojectname.1`` and increment by one for each
  subsequent minor release *regardless of the eventual minor release
  version number used*.
  
  Yes, I'm expecting debate on that one. :) 
  
* Otherwise, the minor release process is essentially identical to
  that of major releases:

  * Incorporate all of the changes you intend to make.
  * Decide on your minor version number.
  * Edit various files to insert the new formal release version number. 
  * Create the minor release branch::
  
      cvs rtag -r Rprojectname.1 -b rel-2-1 modulename
      cvs update -r Rrel-2-0

  * Code freeze.
  * Regression test.
  * Give beta users a shot at it. 
  * Apply CURRENT and RELEASE tags::

      cvs rtag -r rel-2-1 rel-2-1-RELEASE modulename
      cvs rtag -r rel-2-1-RELEASE rel-2-1-CURRENT modulename
      
  * Generate the final archive from RELEASE and post for download.
  * Merge changes back to HEAD. 
  
Open for discussion: I'm not sure whether the major release CURRENT
tag should be moved to the minor release, or a separate CURRENT
maintained for all major and minor releases. I have described the
latter.

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

* Bug fixes can be made directly to the CURRENT version of the
  concerned release branch:: 

    cvs update -r rel-2-0-CURRENT
    vi buggy.py
    cvs commit buggy.py

  The alternative, spawning branches for individual bug fixes, makes
  perfect sense for large projects like Python but is gross overkill
  for a project of this size. 

* Regression tests should then be performed with the test suite. 

* Once you're happy with the fix, update the release CURRENT on a file
  by file basis to ensure that you don't collide with anyone else who
  is fixing bugs::

    cvs tag -F -r rel-2-0-CURRENT buggy.py
    
  .. When we start getting collisions, we change the process. I
     frankly doubt that'll ever happen, given the size of the project.
     --gtk

* To apply the fix, users should download the new CURRENT version of
  the affected files either using anonymous cvs access or the web
  based access to the CVS repository at Sourceforge.

  *Downloadable archives should only be created for formal bug fix
  releases.*

Bug Fix Releases
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* A new bug fix release should be branched from its release via the
  release CURRENT tag, thus incorporating all current bug fixes at
  that time::

    cvs rtag -r rel-2-0-CURRENT -b rel-2-0-1 projectname

  Comprehensive regression testing should then be conducted, any
  mistakes corrected, the changes propagated back to the release
  CURRENT and to HEAD, and the archive created and posted for
  download.

  Subsequent bug fix releases should be spawned off the release
  CURRENT, *never* a previous bug fix release. 


----------
Background
----------

This section exists mainly to document my thinking that led to the
`General Principles`_ below and `Release Life Cycle`_ above. Once
we've nailed everything down, we probably remove it. 

My exposure to branch management (as opposed to the small-scale change
control I've used on my own projects in the past) has been as an
eavesdropper to a team of professional developer who use Perforce.
Their project is large and commercial, requiring a code line
management strategy appropriate to its scale and complexity.

I'm trying to cut this full-scale branch management strategy down to
size to suit the reStructuredText proposal, and at the same time
convert it to suit CVS rather than Perforce.

My notes, in no particular order: 

* As far as I can tell, MAIN is completely bloody useless. I can't tag
  it, I can't check it out... what does it *do*?

* If someone just checks out the repository, they get HEAD, so it
  better always be working. That generates the principle
  `Don't Break Your HEAD`_. 

* As far as I can tell, HEAD is the *anti-branch*. If it's not on a
  branch, it's on HEAD.

* If someone is making major surgery somewhere, that needs to be done
  on a separate branch so that it doesn't interfere with HEAD.

* Releases should also have a branch of their own so that patches or
  point releases can be based off in-use but old releases despite HEAD
  having substantially progressed in the mean time. Hence,
  `All Releases Have Branches`_

* The question, then, is how to deal with releases incorporating the
  result of the aforementioned major surgery. The two more obvious
  options:

  * Branch the release off the major surgery branch. That's how my
    company does it -- Rsurgeryproject is spawned off the Perforce
    idea of main (HEAD, to us), and 4.0 (or whatever its version
    number is) is spawned off Rsurgeryproject.

    Hard work:
    
    * Once you've finished the major surgery, you have to merge in all
      of the changes made to HEAD in the mean time.
      
    * Once you finally generate the release (or at least get things
      stable enough that the code can be inflicted upon everyone
      working on HEAD), you need to merge all of the changes back to
      HEAD.
      
    The other option:
    
  * Branch new releases off HEAD. If you need to incorporate major
    surgery, merge the changes back into HEAD before you branch the
    new release.

    Hopeful advantage:

    * It looks at first like you save a merge or two. 

    Hard work:

    * It turns out that to be able to safely merge the surgery into
      HEAD, you need to merge changes to HEAD into the surgery branch
      first. Then you merge the surgery branch back into HEAD.
      Finally, you branch the release off HEAD.
      
  My gut feel is that the seemingly simpler latter option is just as
  complex as the former, but lacks structural cues to let people know
  what's going on. Accordingly, I'm selecting for the latter, which
  I'll jokingly call the `Major Releases Are Not Hats`_ principle.

* Until we reach the first major release, I'm comfortable with people
  performing major surgery in named branches and merging their changes
  back into HEAD. 

* Until we reach the first major release, ``rel-1-0``, I'm entirely
  comfortable with branching new releases off HEAD.

* Release branches connote... well, that something's ready to release.
  As a code consumer, I'd find it wierd if functionality kept
  appearing and disappearing from what I thought was going to become a
  release. Therefore, `Minimise Changes in Release Branches`_, from
  which comes `Give Upcoming Releases Code Names`_.

  Another reason is that intended release numbers change, something
  else you don't necessarily want to inflict on your users. 
                                  
Having thought things through at least that much, I'm able to derive
the following principles:

General Principles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _All Releases Have Branches: 
   
**All Releases Have Branches**
  If you don't have branches, you easily can't go back, fix something,
  and re-release.

.. _Don't Break Your HEAD: 

**Don't Break Your HEAD**
  HEAD is what you get if you don't specify a branch when you check
  out the code for the first time. HEAD is what you get when you
  ``update -A``. HEAD should work. If you're working on HEAD, get in
  the habit of running regression tests *before* you commit.
  
  Come to think of it, get in the habit of running tests before
  committing nomatter what branch you're working on.
  
.. _Major Releases Are Not Hats:

**Major Releases Are Not Hats**
  Major releases should always be made from a project branch. They
  should never come off the HEAD.

  Exception: Until we reach the first major release, ``rel-1-0``,
  there's no real reason not to branch new releases off HEAD unless
  we're about to make changes big enough to break HEAD. That's true of
  refactoring the test suite, so I've created the ``Rrefactor-test``
  branch.

.. _Minimise Changes in Release Branches:

**Minimise Changes in Release Branches**
  Corollary: only create release branches when you're 99% sure you're
  finished.
  
.. _Give Upcoming Releases Code Names: 

**Give Upcoming Releases Code Names**
  Revealing intended revision numbers is a Bad Idea. You'll get bogged
  down in your work, or some other chunk of work will become more
  important, and before you know it something *else* should be your
  pet version number. That's why we spawn numbered releases only when
  99% ready to release. In the mean time, give your project some
  memorable name.
