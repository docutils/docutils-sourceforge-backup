 README: reStructuredText
==========================

:Author: David Goodger
:Contact: goodger@@users.sourceforge.net
:Date: $Date: 2002/04/18 02:49:03 $
:Web-site: http://structuredtext.sourceforge.net/

Thank you for downloading the reStructuredText project archive.
Development has been transferred to the Docutils_ project.  As this is
a work in progress, please check the project web site for updated
working files.

reStructuredText is an input parser component of the `Python Docstring
Processing System`_, and is installed as
"dps.parsers.restructuredtext".

To run the code, Python 2.0 or later must already be installed.  You
can get Python from http://www.python.org/.  You will also need the
latest DPS package, available from http://docstring.sourceforge.net/.

.. _Docutils: http://docutils.sourceforge.net/
.. _Python Docstring Processing System:
   http://docstring.sourceforge.net/


Project Files & Directories
===========================

* README.txt: You're reading it.

* HISTORY.txt: Release notes for the current and previous project
  releases.

* setup.py: Installation script.  See "Installation" below.

* install.py: Quick & dirty installation script.

* restructuredtext: The project source directory, installed as Python
  package ``dps.parsers.restructuredtext``.

* test: The unit test directory (currently experimental).  Not
  required to use the software, but very useful if you're planning to
  modify it.

* tools: Directory for standalone scripts that use reStructuredText.

  - quicktest.py: Input reStructuredText, output pretty-printed
    pseudo-XML and various other forms.

  - publish.py: A minimal example of a complete Docutils system, using
    the "standalone" reader and "pformat" writer.

  - html.py: Read standalone reStructuredText documents and write
    HTML4/CSS1.  Uses the default.css stylesheet.

* spec: The project specification directory.  Contains the markup
  syntax spec and implementation notes.

* docs: The project user documentation directory.


Installation
============

The first step is to expand the .tar.gz archive.  It contains a
distutils setup file "setup.py".  OS-specific installation
instructions follow.

Linux, Unix, MacOS X
--------------------

1. Open a shell.

2. Go to the directory created by expanding the archive::

       cd <archive_directory_path>

3. Install the package::

       python setup.py install

   If the python executable isn't on your path, you'll have to specify
   the complete path, such as /usr/local/bin/python.  You may need
   root permissions to complete this step.

   You can also just run install.py; it does the same thing.

Windows
-------

1. Open a DOS box (Command Shell, MSDOS Prompt, or whatever they're
   calling it these days).

2. Go to the directory created by expanding the archive::

       cd <archive_directory_path>

3. Install the package::

       <path_to_python.exe>\python setup.py install

If your system is set up to run Python when you double-click on .py
files, you can run install.py to do the same as the above.

MacOS
-----

1. Open the folder containing the expanded archive.

2. Double-click on the file "setup.py", which should be a "Python
   module" file.

   If the file isn't a "Python module", the line endings are probably
   also wrong, and you will need to set up your system to recognize
   ".py" file extensions as Python files.  See
   http://gotools.sourceforge.net/mac/python.html for detailed
   instructions.  Once set up, it's easiest to start over by expanding
   the archive again.

3. The distutils options window will appear.  From the "Command" popup
   list choose "install", click "Add", then click "OK".

If install.py is a "Python module" (see step 2 above if it isn't), you
can run it instead of steps 2 and 3 above.  The distutils options
windown will not appear.


Usage
=====

After installing both the reStructuredText and DPS packages, start
with the html.py and publish.py front-ends from the unpacked
reStructuredText "tools" subdirectory.  Both take up to two arguments,
the source path and destination path, with STDIN and STDOUT being the
defaults.
