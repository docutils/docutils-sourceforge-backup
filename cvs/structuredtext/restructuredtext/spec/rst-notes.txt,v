To Do
=====

- Document!

  - Keep the quickref up to date.
  - Internal module documentation.
  - User docs.
  - Add motivation sections for constructs.

- Refactor the complicated bits of the parser.

  - Rename methods & variables according to the coding conventions set
    out in dps-notes.txt_

    .. _dps-notes.txt:
       http://docstring.sourceforge.net/spec/dps-notes.txt

- Create a standalone reStructuredText -> HTML/XML converter (stdin ->
  stdout filter).  (Flesh out tools/quicktest.py.)

- Allow very long titles (on two or more lines)?

- And for the sake of completeness, should definition list terms be
  allowed to be very long (two or more lines) also?

- Allow hyperlink references to targets in other documents?  Not in an
  HTML-centric way, though (it's trivial to say
  ``http://www.whatever.com/doc#name``, and useless in non-HTML
  contexts).  XLink/XPointer?  ``.. baseref::``?  See Doc-SIG
  2001-08-10.

- Add character processing?  For example:

  - ``--`` -> em-dash (or ``--`` -> en-dash, and ``---`` -> em-dash).
    (Look for pre-existing conventions.)
  - Convert quotes to curly quote entities.  (Essentially impossible
    for HTML?  Unnecessary for TeX.  An output issue?)
  - Various forms of ``:-)`` to smiley icons.
  - ``"\ "`` -> &nbsp;.
  - Escaped newlines -> <BR>.
  - Escaped period or quote as a disappearing catalyst to allow
    character-level inline markup?
  - Others?

  How to represent character entities in the text though?  Probably as
  Unicode.

  Which component is responsible for this, the parser, the reader, or
  the writer?

- Implement the header row separator modification to table.el.  (Wrote
  to Takaaki Ota & the table.el mailing list on 2001-08-12, suggesting
  support for '=====' header rows.  On 2001-08-17 he replied, saying
  he'd put it on his to-do list, but "don't hold your breath".)

- Tony says inline markup rule 7 could do with a *little* more
  exposition in the spec, to make clear what is going on for people
  with head colds.

- Alan Jaffray suggested (and I agree) that it would be sensible to:

  - have a directive to specify a default role for interpreted text
  - allow the reST processor to take an argument for the default role
  - issue a warning when processing documents with no default role
    which contain interpreted text with no explicitly specified role

- Fix the parser's indentation handling to conform with the stricter
  definition in the spec.  (Explicit markup blocks should be strict or
  forgiving?)

- Tighten up the spec for indentation of "constructs using complex
  markers": field lists and option lists?  Bodies may begin on the
  same line as the marker or on a subsequent line (with blank lines
  optional).  Require that for bodies beginning on the same line as
  the marker, all lines be in strict alignment.  Currently, this is
  acceptable::

      :Field-name-of-medium-length: Field body beginning on the same
          line as the field name.

  This proposal would make the above example illegal, instead
  requiring strict alignment.  A field body may either begin on the
  same line::

      :Field-name-of-medium-length: Field body beginning on the same
                                    line as the field name.

  Or it may begin on a subsequent line::

      :Field-name-of-medium-length:
          Field body beginning on a line subsequent to that of the
          field name.

  This would be especially relevant in degenerate cases like this::

      :Number-of-African-swallows-requried-to-carry-a-coconut:
          It would be very difficult to align the field body with
          the left edge of the first line if it began on the same
          line as the field name.

- Implement directives:

  - html.imagemap

  - components.endnotes, .citations, .topic, .sectnum (section
    numbering; add support to .contents; could be cmdline option also)

  - misc.raw

  - misc.include: ``#include`` one file in another.  But how to
    parse wrt sections, reference names, conflicts?

  - misc.exec: Execute Python code & insert the results.  Perhaps
    dangerous?

  - misc.eval: Evaluate an expression & insert the text.  At parse
    time or at substitution time?

  - block.qa: Questions & Answers.  Implement as a generic two-column
    marked list?  Or as a standalone construct?

  - block.columns: Multi-column table/list, with number of columns as
    argument.

  - colorize.python: Colorize Python code.  Fine for HTML output, but
    what about other formats?  Revert to a literal block?  Do we need
    some kind of "alternate" mechanism?  Perhaps use a "pending"
    transform, which could switch its output based on the "format" in
    use.  Use a factory function "transformFF()" which returns either
    "HTMLTransform()" instance or "GenericTransform" instance?

  - text.date: Datestamp.  For substitutions.

    - Combined with misc.include, implement canned macros?

- Allow directives to be added at run-time.

- Use the language module for directive attribute names?

- Add more attributes to the image directive: align, border?

- Allow syntax constructs to be added or disabled at run-time.

- Make footnotes two-way, GNU-style?  What if there are multiple
  references to a single footnote?

- Add RFC-2822 header parsing (for PEP, email Readers).

- Change ``.. meta::`` to use a "pending" element, only activated for
  HTML writers.

- Allow for variant styles by interpreting indented lists as if they
  weren't indented?  For example, currently the list below will be
  parsed as a list within a block quote::

      paragraph

        * list item 1
        * list item 2

  But a lot of people seem to write that way, and HTML browsers make
  it look as if that's the way it should be.  The parser could check
  the contents of block quotes, and if they contain only a single
  list, remove the block quote wrapper.  There would be two problems:

  1. What if we actually *do* want a list inside a block quote?

  2. What if such a list comes immediately after an indented
     construct, such as a literal block?

  Both could be solved using empty comments (problem 2 already exists
  for a block quote after a literal block).  But that's a hack.

  See the Doc-SIG discussion starting 2001-04-18 with Ed Loper's
  "Structuring: a summary; and an attempt at EBNF", item 4.

- Add a "verse" construct, for paragraphs with linebreaks preserved?
  A directive would be easy; what about a literal-block-like prefix,
  perhaps ';;'?  E.g.::

      Take it away, Eric the orchestra leader!  ;;

          Half a bee,
          Philosophically,
          Must ipso-facto
          Half not be.
          You see?

          ...


Or Not To Do?
=============

This is the realm of the possible but questionably probable.  These
ideas are kept here as a record of what has been proposed, for
posterity and in case any of them prove to be useful.


Compound Enumerated Lists
-------------------------

(A future revision of this specification may allow for compound
enumerators, such as '1.1.' or '1.a.' or '1(a)', to allow for nested
enumerated lists without indentation.)


Auto-Numbered Enumerated Lists
------------------------------

Add these?  Example::

    #. Item 1.
    #. Item 2.
    #. Item 3.

Arabic numerals only, or any sequence if first initialized?  For
example::

    a) Item a.
    #) Item b.
    #) Item c.


Sloppy Indentation of List Items
--------------------------------

Perhaps the indentation shouldn't be so strict.  Currently, this is
required::

    1. First line,
       second line.

Anything wrong with this? ::

    1. First line,
     second line.

Problem?

    1. First para.

       Block quote.  (no good: requires some indent relative to first
       para)

     Second Para.

    2. Have to carefully define where the literal block ends::

         Literal block

       Literal block?

Hmm...  Non-strict indentation isn't such a good idea.


Lazy Indentation of List Items
------------------------------

Another approach: Going back to the first draft of reStructuredText
(2000-11-27 post to Doc-SIG)::

    - This is the fourth item of the main list (no blank line above).
    The second line of this item is not indented relative to the
    bullet, which precludes it from having a second paragraph.

Change that to *require* a blank line above and below, to reduce
ambiguity.  This "loosening" may be added later, once the parser's
been nailed down.  However, a serious drawback of this approach is to
limit the content of each list item to a single paragraph.


David's Idea for Lazy Indentation
`````````````````````````````````

Consider a paragraph in a word processor.  It is a single logical line
of text which ends with a newline, soft-wrapped arbitrarily at the
right edge of the page or screen.  We can think of a plaintext
paragraph in the same way, as a single logical line of text, ending
with two newlines (a blank line) instead of one, and which may contain
arbitrary line breaks (newlines) where it was accidentally
hard-wrapped by an application.  We can compensate for the accidental
hard-wrapping by "unwrapping" every unindented second and subsequent
line.  The indentation of the first line of a paragraph or list item
would determine the indentation for the entire element.  Blank lines
would be required between list items when using lazy indentation.

The following example shows the lazy indentation of multiple body
elements::

    - This is the first paragraph
    of the first list item.

      Here is the second paragraph
    of the first list item.

    - This is the first paragraph
    of the second list item.

      Here is the second paragraph
    of the second list item.

A more complex example shows the limitations of lazy indentation::

    - This is the first paragraph
    of the first list item.

      Next is a definition list item:

      Term
          Definition.  The indentation of the term is
    required, as is the indentation of the definition's
    first line.

          When the definition extends to more than
    one line, lazy indentation may occur.  (This is the second
    paragraph of the definition.)

    - This is the first paragraph
    of the second list item.

      - Here is the first paragraph of
    the first item of a nested list.

      So this paragraph would be outside of the nested list,
    but inside the second list item of the outer list.

    But this paragraph is not part of the list at all.

And the ambiguity remains::

    - Look at the hyphen at the beginning of the next line
    - is it a second list item marker, or a dash in the text?

    Similarly, we may want to refer to numbers inside enumerated
    lists:

    1. How many socks in a pair? There are
    2. How many pants in a pair? Exactly
    1. Go figure.

Literal blocks and block quotes would still require consistent
indentation for all their lines.  For block quotes, we might be able
to get away with only requiring that the first line of each contained
element be indented.  For example::

    Here's a paragraph.

        This is a paragraph inside a block quote.
    Second and subsequent lines need not be indented at all.

        - A bullet list inside
    the block quote.

          Second paragraph of the
    bullet list inside the block quote.

Although feasible, this form of lazy indentation has problems.  The
document structure and hierarchy is not obvious from the indentation,
making the source plaintext difficult to read.  This will also make
keeping track of the indentation while writing difficult and
error-prone.  However, these problems may be acceptable for Wikis and
email mode, where we may be able to rely on less complex structure
(few nested lists, for example).

Two-For-One Literal Blocks

[Aside: One possible variation is for meta-documentation (perhaps an
extension?): use triple-colons (':::') or a directive ('..
literal-parsed::') to indicate 'take the following literal block, mark
it up as a literal block, then copy it and mark it up as if it weren't
a literal block'.  The implementation may insert text in-between, such
as 'Marked up as:', or may alter the formatting (different font, set
in a colored box, whatever).]

Horizontal Rules
----------------

Wolfgang Lipp suggested adding horizontal rules (HTML <HR>) to the
syntax.  A line of punctuation with a blank line before and after::

    Para.

    ------------------------------------------------------------

    Para.

The problem is, HRs are purely presentational.  What structural
significance do they have?

Hmm. Stories are often broken up into "segments" with vertical
whitespace, sometimes with a horizontal line or a group of symbols
(e.g. three widely-separated asterisks). This could be modeled by
horizontal rules.

HRs could be allowed to be indented without generating a block quote::

    Para.

        --------

    Para.

Tony Ibbs' mention of HRs on 2001-10-16 triggered an idea from the
nether regions of my cerebrum, relating to constructs commonly seen in
novels and short fiction.  Rummaging around in my copy of The Chicago
Manual of Style, 14th ed., I found this confirmation (sect. 1.80):

    Instead of subheads, extra space or a type ornament between
    paragraphs may be used to mark text divisions or to signal
    changes in subject or emphasis.

In other words, "anonymous sections"! *There's* the structural
significance. An HTML Writer could render these text divisions as
horizontal rules if it likes.

- Add to spec: discussion of directive behavior:

    I think most directives won't survive (as directives) past the
    parsing stage (they can't, since they're a *parser
    construct*). Instead, they'll transform their contents into
    elements on the doc tree. Only unknown directives will survive to
    any later stage, and be formatted in a generic "directive" way,
    perhaps as a system warning.
    
    Now, the newly transformed directive *contents* may be specialized
    elements which require further processing later on, but they're no
    longer raw directives.

Comments Revisited
------------------

Perhaps comments should be one-liners only? Would this mean that
footnotes, hyperlink targets, and directives must also be
one-liners?

If we adopt Tony Ibbs' suggested "comment" directive, we could limit
a comment to a single text block. A "multi-block comment" could use
"comment-start" and "comment-end" directives. This would remove the
indentation-incompatibility.


Parser Notes
============

Wonky cases, marked by "XXX" in the unit tests:

- What should incorrect indentation do? E.g.::

      Here is a paragraph.

              Indent 8 spaces.

          Indent 4 spaces.

  As is, this generates a <block_quote><block_quote>...</>...</>.
  Should this trigger a warning?

- Is this correct behavior? ::

      -
      Empty item, no blank line, but no space after hyphen.

  Currently this generates a single paragraph.

- Multi-line comments are incompatible with block quotes::

      + bullet

      .. a comment used to end a bullet before a blockquote
         (if you can't think of what to write in the paragraph)

        blockquote
