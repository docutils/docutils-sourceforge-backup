This is *emphasis*. This is **strong**.

This is an ``inline literal``.

Internal crossreferences, like example_. 

Footnote references, like [5]_ and
[RM98]_. Note that footnotes may get
rearranged, e.g., to the bottom of
the "page".

.. [5] A numerical footnote. Note
   there's no colon after the ``]``.
.. [RM98] And a reference
   (as often used in journals).

.. _example: 

This is an example crossreference target. 

Why not look at `Project Files & Directories`_?

Block quotes are just: 

    Indented paragraphs, 

        and they may nest. 

Here's a definition list:

what
  Definition lists associate a term with
  a definition.

how
  The term is a one-line phrase, and the
  definition is one or more paragraphs or
  body elements, indented relative to the
  term. Blank lines are not allowed
  between term and definition.

Thank you for downloading the reStructuredText project archive. As
this is a work in progress, please check the project web site for
updated working files. The latest release archive is available at
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=7050.

reStructuredText is an input parser component of the `Python Docstring
Processing System`_, and is installed as
"dps.parsers.restructuredtext".

To run the code, Python 2.0 or later must already be installed. You
can get Python from http://www.python.org/. You will also need the
latest DPS package, available from http://docstring.sourceforge.net/.

Project Files & Directories
===========================

* README.txt: You're reading it.

* HISTORY.txt: Release notes for the current and previous project
  releases.

* setup.py: Installation script. See "Installation" below.

* install.py: Quick & dirty installation script.

* restructuredtext: The project source directory, installed as Python
  package ``dps.parsers.restructuredtext``.

* test: The unit test directory (currently experimental). Not required
  to use the software, but very useful if you're planning to modify
  it.

* tools: Directory for standalone scripts that use reStructuredText.

  - quicktest.py: Input reStructuredText, output pretty-printed
    pseudo-XML.

* spec: The project specification directory. Contains the markup
  syntax spec and implementation notes.

* docs: The project documentation directory.


Installation
============

The first step is to expand the .tar.gz archive. It contains a
distutils setup file "setup.py". OS-specific installation instructions
follow.

Linux, Unix, MacOS X
--------------------

1. Open a shell.

2. Go to the directory created by expanding the archive::

       cd <archive_directory_path>

3. Install the package::

       python setup.py install

   If the python executable isn't on your path, you'll have to specify
   the complete path, such as /usr/local/bin/python. You may need root
   permissions to complete this step.

You can also just run install.py; it does the same thing.

Windows
-------

1. Open a DOS box (Command Shell, MSDOS Prompt, or whatever they're
   calling it these days).

2. Go to the directory created by expanding the archive::

       cd <archive_directory_path>

3. Install the package::

       <path_to_python.exe>\python setup.py install

If your system is set up to run Python when you double-click on .py
files, you can run install.py to do the same as the above.

MacOS
-----

1. Open the folder containing the expanded archive.

2. Double-click on the file "setup.py", which should be a "Python
   module" file.

   If the file isn't a "Python module", the line endings are probably
   also wrong, and you will need to set up your system to recognize
   ".py" file extensions as Python files. See
   http://gotools.sourceforge.net/mac/python.html for detailed
   instructions. Once set up, it's easiest to start over by expanding
   the archive again.

3. The distutils options window will appear. From the "Command" popup
   list choose "install", click "Add", then click "OK".

If install.py is a "Python module" (see step 2 above if it isn't), you
can run it instead of the above. The distutils options windown will
not appear.
