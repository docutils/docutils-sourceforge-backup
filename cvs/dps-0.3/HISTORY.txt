========================

* dps/nodes.py: Added to project.

* dps/test_nodes.py: Added to project.

* dps/utils.py: Added to project.

* dps/test_utils.py: Added to project.

* dps/statemachine.py (1.2):

  - Added exceptions: UnknownTransitionError,
    DuplicateTransitionError, TransitionPatternNotFound,
    TransitionMethodNotFound, UnexpectedIndentationError.
  - Changed StateMachine.lineno to lineoffset.
  - Added methods to StateMachine: unlink(), gotoline(),
    gettextblock(), getunindented(), abslineoffset(), abslineno().
  - Changed StateMachine method signatures: addtransitions(),
    addtransition().
  - Changed function extractindented(), and StateMachineWS methods
    getindented(), getknownindented(), and getfirstknownindented():
    added a 'blankfinish' boolean return value to each.
  - Fixed a bug in StateMachineWS methods getindented(),
    getknownindented(), and getfirstknownindented(), where an empty
    block caused an infinite loop.
  - Changed State's transition storage (instance attributes
    transitions & transitionorder).
  - Added methods to State: unlink(), removetransition().
  - Relaxed State.patterns contents: values can be strings or compiled
    patterns; strings will be compiled by State.maketransition().

* dps/test_statemachine.py: Modified per statemachine.py changes.
