transforms: replaced SectionTargets and ChainedTargets by PropagateTargets,
which propagates internal empty targets to the next element;

wait until the next rewrite;
added Element.note_referenced_by auxiliary function;
added true support for multiple names and ids in target elements;
added FinalChecks to transform list of totest['hyperlinks'];
added auxiliary uniq function
