Two things to the underlining function for emacs:

1. when the underlining is invoked with a negative argument
   on a line that has no decoration, we should not interpret
   that as a style switch (box vs simple). This is reserved
   for a positive prefix-arg only.  This is more consistent
   with the behaviour when there already is some decoration
   present on the current title.

2. changed the default sectioning char to a list, and the
   underlining function to suggest a new underlining char
   (i.e. one that is not already present in the file),
   choosing it from the list formed by the difference between
   the preferred sectioning chars and the chars already in
   the file, when rotating the section underlines.

   This is really useful, because in practice, you often
   start a new file, and need to underline a new section
   which doesn't have other existing underlining. By using
   the list in the rest-preferred-characters variables
   you can specify your usual preferred order for sectioning
   chars and the new suggested character is automatically
   the one you're expecting. I set the default preferred
   list to something reasonable, =, then -, then ~, then
   other stuff.  Feel free to customize for your own needs.

   Note that the order that is already present in the file
   is used above the preferred chars list.  The preferred
   list is only used to suggest new characters.

This is getting pretty cool.  I feel like this is probably
the end of feature enhancements for this function.  Very
happy with it.
