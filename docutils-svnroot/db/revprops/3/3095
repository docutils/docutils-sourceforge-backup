Checked in current state of refactoring towards support of multiple IDs.
The 'id' attribute is replaced by an 'ids' attribute (a list).
The same will happen later for 'name' (-> 'names') and 'class' (-> 'classes').
Py21-compatibility is currently lost, but it may come back when
the refactoring is finished.
