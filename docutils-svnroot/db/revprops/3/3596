replaced data argument to Transform constructor with **kwargs;
Transform.data contains now the kwargs dictionary;
added transform instance to Transformer.applied tuples again -- this
shouldn't cause problems with pickling because the Transformer
isn't pickled; if it does cause any problems, please follow up
on Docutils-develop
END
