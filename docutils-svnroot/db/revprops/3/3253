str(Exception) doesn't work for anything but ASCII Exception texts, so
'%s' % exception_instance is unsafe unless exception_instance.args
contains only byte strings.

The change in alltests.py is a first attempt to catch such cases where
a str(Exception) is done with an Exception text which is not
necessarily ASCII-only (i.e. with a unicode string in Exception.args),
but since most input data (in the totest dicts) is passed in as byte
strings, it doesn't catch much.
