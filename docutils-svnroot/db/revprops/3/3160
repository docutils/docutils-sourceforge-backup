fixed some relative-path issues;
since CustomTestCase.setUp now automatically changes to the test root directory,
it is now necessary to provide paths relative to the testroot to allow
running test_tables and test_include from working directories other than the
test root;
in test_settings.py, there is still such a line
    mydir = os.path.dirname(fixpath.func_code.co_filename)
but there it is correct (and cannot be easily changed)
