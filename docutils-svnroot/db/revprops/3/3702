Inline markup rule 7 says:

7. An unescaped backslash preceding a start-string or end-string will
   disable markup recognition, except for the end-string of `inline
   literals`_.  See `Escaping Mechanism`_ above for details.

That's absolutely fine.  The referenced "Escaping Mechanism" section
explains it all in detail.
