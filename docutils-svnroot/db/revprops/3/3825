Turned components.Filter into components.WriterFilter.  When the
Filter transform is run, the only type of component which has not yet
been used *and* has the notion of a "format" is the writer.  I (Felix)
cannot imagine a use case where components.Filter would filter, say,
parser-specific nodes.  Thus, it's possible to make components.Filter
specific to writers without loss of functionality.

Added FormatSpecific node.  Made "meta" and "raw" subclasses of
nodes.FormatSpecific.

nodes.Node.traverse: When a class is passed as first argument, do not
check if it is a subclass of nodes.Node.  This is necessary because
some node classes (like nodes.FormatSpecific) aren't subclasses of
nodes.Node.

directives.meta: Do not insert pending nodes but rather the meta node
directly.

components.WriterFilter does no longer work on pending nodes but
traverses the document tree looking for FormatSpecific nodes.

Removed format-handling code for raw node from writers.  This is now
done by the WriterFilter transform.

Removed test/test_transforms/test_filter.py; that test isn't usable
for testing the WriterFilter transform.  components.WriterFilter is
automatically tested in the functional tests; that's enough for now.

Updated docs/ref/transforms.txt.

Partially updated docs/peps/pep-0258.txt.
