- Added new funtion and binding to display the Table of Contents
  and jump to any section title from it (press return);

- Renamed a rest-display-secitons-hierarchy to 
  rest-display-decorations-hierarchy which is more accurate.

- Replaced C-x C-= binding by the new more useful TOC display
  feature.  The display hierarchy feature is still available
  by calling this with a prefix-argument.
