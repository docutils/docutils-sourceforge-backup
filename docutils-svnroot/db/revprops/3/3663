separated default (universal) transforms into two stages so that no
transform is applied twice;
do not delete document.transformer in publish_doctree (Martin, this may be
important for the pickle writer -- you may need to delete document.transformer);
regenerate reporter object unconditionally; do so in publish_from_doctree,
not the doctree reader;
added tests;
I will post about all that on Docutils-develop in one or two days
