I have cleaned up all the emacs support code for restructured text.
If you are using it, this will most certainly affect you, here are
the list of changes:

1. I moved the contents of restructuredtext.el, rst-mode.el and
   rst-html.el into a single file, named rst.el, and removed the old
   files.  You can remove the old files from your load-path and
   replace them with rst.el, the old files are to be considered
   OBSOLETE from now (2005-10-30).  All new contents will go to
   rst.el.

2. All the rest-* function names from restructuredtext.el have been
   RENAMED to rst-* (to be consistent with the code that was in
   rst-mode.el).  Almost all the contents of rst.el now start with
   rst-.

3. rst-text-mode-hook has been renamed to rst-text-mode-bindings.
   Because it is not a hook, but rather a function to be bound to a
   hook.  This was confusing and is now following the general emacs
   conventions.  This will affect you if you were enabling the
   adjusting and toc functions.

4. I removed the rst-html-stylesheet and the simpler rst-html-compile
   function.  It was replaced by the implementation of
   rst-html-html-comple-with-conf, which is more generic, and which
   now also uses the rst-html-options.

In addition, I wrote a document that describes how to use all the
features included in rst.el, because many emacs users I meet are not
aware of them.  You will be able to find it under
docs/user/emacs.txt.  I linked to it from the index page.
