V 340
removed coding guideline items which are contained in PEP 8;
shortened warning about "svn import" -- it's not as dangerous as it
used to be in CVS;
removed reference to Python Check-in Policies because it's not of much
use for us -- many items are not applicable and some even contradict
what we're currently doing (e.g. bug/patch tracking)
END
