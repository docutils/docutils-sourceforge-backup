Moved rst2ht to link list; it's not a blog.
Moved htmlnav to link list; it's not a blog either.
Removed restblog; it's outdated and doesn't work.
Removed ReSTWeb; the current URL is <http://wingware.com/pub/restweb/>
and it doesn't look like it's maintained anymore.
Removed redundant HT2HTML-integration link; it's the same as rst2ht.

END
