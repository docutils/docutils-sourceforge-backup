Apply tuple_args_guard.patch [ 2993967 ] 

When there are any attributes which have tuple attribute values DOM
rendering fails because string interpolation receives a wrong number
of arguments. It needs to be safeguarded against this case by
carefully packing the values into a tuple beforehand.

This problem might crop up in other places as well.
