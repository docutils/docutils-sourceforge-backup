Fix [ 3527842 ]. 

Under Python 3, converted tests and tools are now
stored in the ``test3/`` and ``tools3/`` sub-directories and not
installed in the PYTHONPATH.

In order to make this work:
- Make tests independent from the location of the ``test/`` directory.
- Use converted sources from the ``build/`` directory for tests under
  Python 3.

Remove functional/tests/stylesheet_path_html4css1.py made
redunant by functional/tests/math_output_html.py.
END
