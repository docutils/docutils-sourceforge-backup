Major merge with Emacs source tree. Docutils SVN version and Emacs
trunk are kept in sync from now on. New version is supposed to appear
in Emacs 24.2.

User visible changes:

* Switch meaning of keybindings ``C-M-a`` and ``C-M-e``

  They were wrong in the first place :-( . Sorry for changing bindings
  again.

* Added faces `rst-transition` and `rst-adornment`

  New faces are used instead of directly using
  `font-lock-keyword-face`.

* Improved customization of `rst-adornment-faces-alist`

  Hopefully this will not break existing customization.

* Character syntax adopted to match plain text again

Other code improvements suggested by Emacs developers:

* Replaced use of `defun`\s from `cl.el` by own definitions

* Improved lots and lots of comments and documentation strings
  including spelling fixes

* Fixed version stuff

* Improved some functions

* Byte-compiling emits no warnings and works

* Added tests

Other improvements:

* Default for customizing `rst-adornment-faces-alist` is now safe

  Thanks to Samuel Bronson for the patch.

END
