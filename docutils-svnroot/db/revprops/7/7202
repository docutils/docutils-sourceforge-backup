rstxml2xml.py is a script that uses sax to add some functionality to
an resulting docutils XML file that is not there (such as rawxml, and
converting ASCIIMathML to MathMl). Docutils got some fixes so it will
work on other systems, such as using variables rather than hard-coded
paths to find the scripts.
