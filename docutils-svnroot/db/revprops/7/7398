User visible changes:

* Symbols follow reStructuredText syntax more closely

  This implies that role and directive names with internal
  underscores, plus signs and colons are handled correctly. This is
  particularly important for Sphinx users where embedded colons are
  used frequently for this purpose.

* `rst-compile-toolsets` is now customizable

  In addition the default value first looks for a `rst2*.py` and uses
  it if found or uses the `rst2*` command.

  Thanks to Emacs developers for this.

* Use faces not variables for font-lock customization

  There are now customizable `rst-*` faces which are used. The old
  `rst-*-face` variables are still there but deprecated.

  Thanks to Emacs developers for this.

* Font-locking revised again slightly

Other changes:

* Merge with the changes made in Emacs main line up to bazaar revision
  106782

* Minor cleanup
