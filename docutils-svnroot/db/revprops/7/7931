Replaced macros `rst-iterate-leftmost-...` by new function
`rst-apply-indented-blocks`. Refactored `rst-enumerate-region`,
`rst-bullet-list-region` and `rst-line-block-region` to use
`rst-apply-indented-blocks`.

Improved `rst-enumerate-region` and `rst-bullet-list-region` to not
indent empty lines and not indent lines before indented block.
Debugged those commands to not run into endless loops on blocks at the
end of a buffer missing a final newline.

Improved `rst-line-block-region` to not kill indentation.

END
