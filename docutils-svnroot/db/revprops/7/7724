Complete refactoring:

* Standard docutils infrastructure is used

* There is a Python based approach besides the XSLT based approach

* XSLT and Python based approach are implemented as standard Docutils
  reader / parser / writer

Python implementation has some failing tests because Python
implementation is not yet as mature as XSLT implementation.

XSLT implementation fails for one test which is beyond the
capabilities of XSLT.
