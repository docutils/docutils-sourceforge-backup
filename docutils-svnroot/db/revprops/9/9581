Fix "latex" writer broken in [r9541].

Adding the "template" setting to the list of registered
"relative paths" prevented finding the default template file
in the LATEX_WRITER_DIR.

Unfortunately, the test suite did not detect this breakage.
It seems only to happen when using the "latex" writer from the command line
(via rst2latex or docutils --writer="latex").
END
