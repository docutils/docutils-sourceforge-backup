More user-friendly DocInfo transform.

More detailled feedback when extracting data from a bibliographic field fails.

In bibliographic fields expecting a single paragraph (e.g. "author"),
restore enumerated lists originating in ambiguous markup like
"A. Einstein" (name with initial): in the given context, an we know that this
should not be an enumeration, so fixing is better than throwing an error.

Fix some cases of "ersatz" Boolean values from pre Python 2.3 times.
