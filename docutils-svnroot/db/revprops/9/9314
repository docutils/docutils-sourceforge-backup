`locale.getdefaultlocale()` is deprecated in Python 0.11

Let `smartquotes.py` to use `locale.getlocale` instead.
(Only used if this module is called as standalone application.)

Suppress warning in `docutils.io`:
* Don't change current behaviour without advance warning.
* The deprecated function is called inside a try-block with catchall,
  so this will not lead to errors once it is removed
  (if we were to keep the code until then).

Fixes [bugs:#464].
