Don't use on Pythons default encoding if "input_encoding" setting is None.

If the "input_encoding" setting is None, the encoding of an
input source should be auto-detected with a heuristic.

Under Python 3, auto-detection was only used if reading a file
with Python's default encoding failed.

Resulting problems:

* EncodingWarning (PEP 597) in Python >= 3.10.

* Optional BOM not dropped from utf-8 encoded files.

* If the usrers locale sets an 8-bit encoding,
  files in other 8-bit encodings, UTF-8, and UTF-16 show
  character mix-up (mojibake) (self-declared encoding ignored as
  reading in 8-bit encoding does not lead to errors).
