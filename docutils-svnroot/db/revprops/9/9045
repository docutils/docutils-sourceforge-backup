Update PEP base URL and template.

The canonical PEP base URL changed to "peps.python.org/".

The PEP-writer template.txt added a "source" link that no longer
works due to sources now only be stored on github and having
two possible file extensions ("txt" or "rst").
Adapt the header to resemble the header of official PEP documents
(which are now produced using Sphinx).

Fixes [bug:#445].
