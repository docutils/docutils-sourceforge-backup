Update/fix "standard" functional test sample.

Fix a factual error
(footnotes must be indented at least 1 space, not 3).

Reword HTML-centric descriptions -- we use the sample for several
writer tests.

Revert change of expected pseudo-xml sample extension from "txt" to "rst"
(side-effect of the switch to "rst" extension for rst sources).
END
