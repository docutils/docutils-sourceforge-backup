Config setting "root-prefix": configurable root directory for included files.

Cf. [feature-requests:#91]

The "root_prefix" setting is also applied when a writer converts an image
URI to a local filesystem path.
(The image file may be red by the writer to get the image size (HTML
writers) or to embed it in the output (HTML5 and ODT writers).)
