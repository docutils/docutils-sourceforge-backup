Fix doctree element attribute datatype definition and description.

Local tests revealed inconsistencies and omissions in the DTD
and its documentation.

Use aliases in doctree.txt for links where the id would clash with the ids
of element sections (e.g. `document`_ -> `document <rST document_>`__).
