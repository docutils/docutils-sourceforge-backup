Fix missing whitespace around operator.

flake8 rules
E225: missing whitespace around operator
E226: missing whitespace around arithmetic operator
E228: missing whitespace around modulo operator

Keep ignoring the latter two rules:
PEP8 limits the recommendation to "operators with lowest priority"
"if operators with different priorities are used".
flake8 also flags top level operators.
END
