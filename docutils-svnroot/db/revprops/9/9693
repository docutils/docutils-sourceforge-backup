Doctree validation: Refactor element category classes.

Reconcile element category classes in `docutils.nodes` with descriptions
in doctree.txt and make them fit for use in declarations of valid
children.

- Define and use new class `SubRoot` for elements that may only be used as
  direct children of `document`.

- Drop `Structural` from base classes of `document`.

- Make `Invisible` a subclass of `Special`.
  Use this to simplify class definitions of `Invisible` special elements.
