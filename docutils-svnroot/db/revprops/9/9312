Fix [bugs:#384]: allow omission of citations with "use_bibtex" setting.

If the "use_bibtex" LaTeX writer setting is active (i.e. not empty),
citations are added by LaTeX/BibTeX from a database for all citation references
in the document.
The reference resolver transform now skips `citation_reference` nodes instead of
expecting matching `citation` nodes in this case.

"use_bibtex" content is now transformed to a list by the
`frontend.validate_comma_separated_list()` validator.
As BibTeX works only with "LaTeX citations", the "use_latex_citations" setting
is set to True whenever "use_bibtex" is not empty.

Update documentation.

The test function, added in the last commit, now passes.
END
