Fix node categories.

`rubric` is a Simple Body Element: add `General` to base classes.

`field` is also used for non-registered docinfo items:
add `Bibliographic` to  base classes.

`decoration` is no category member of "Decorative Elements".
Change base class `Decoration` to `PreBibliographic`.

Adapt the `frontmatter.DocInfo` transform: skip `decoration`
(not `Decorative`) when looking for the insertion point of the
bibliographic fields.
This fixes a test failure with wrong position of header/footer.
