Avoid dependency of functional tests on PIL/Pillow.

Don't use "scale" image directive option in functional test.

The expected output for the "image" directive with "scale" option
is tested in `test_writers/test_html5_polyglot_parts.py` and
`test_writers/test_html4css1_parts.py` with special-casing
for missing PIL.
