Scan documentation for trailing whitespace with "pre-commit" hooks.

Remove the exception of documentation sources from the "trailing whitespace"
hook in ".pre-commit-config.yaml" so that commits to a local git-svn repository
will prevent trailing whitespace from slipping into the repository.

Change the Emacs "Local variables" block so that the FORM FEED (^L) character used
to make emacs stop looking for local variables in unrelated text is no longer
a trailing whitespace (and hence not removed by the pre-commit hook),
cf. the docutils-develop thread starting 2024-04-24.
Other trailing whitespace that crept into the repository is removed.

Once at it, also add "mode: rst" (keeping "mode: indented-text" as fallback).
END
