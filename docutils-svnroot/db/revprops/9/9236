Make the tests agnostic to the working directory

Previously, the test suite only worked when the current working
directory was ``docutils/test/`. With this change all relative paths
are calculated explicitly such that the working directory no longer
affects the tests, meaning a less fragile test environment and 
greater flexibility to use test runners other than ``alltests.py``.
This is part of the test suite refactoring project.
