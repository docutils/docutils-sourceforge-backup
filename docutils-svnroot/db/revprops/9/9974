Wrap setting the default "locale" in try/except, report locale.Error as warning.

Docutils command line tools use `locale.setlocale()` to set the locale to the user's
default locale. This may lead to a `locale.Error` if there are problems in the
systems locale setup. As locale settings are not critical for the working of
Docutils (but may affect the output in certain instances), we now clear the
exception and report a WARNING.

Fixes bug #495.
