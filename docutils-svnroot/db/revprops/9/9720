Doctree validation: new transform `universal.Validate`.

Recursive validating is now done in a dedicated "transform".

The new transform `transforms.universal.Validate` is added
by the "parser" component.
If the "validate" setting is True, it traverses the document tree
validating all nodes. Problems are reported as "warning" type
system messages.

`nodes.Element.validate()` no longer recursively validates the element's
children. It always raises a ValueError on problems.
