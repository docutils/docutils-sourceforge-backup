Simplify/update utils.punctuation_chars and generating script.

Since Python 3.3 (PEP 393), all Python builds have support for the full range
of Unicode, and hence there are no longer "wide" and "narrow" builds.
Patch by Adam Turner.

Review/refactoring of ``generate_punctuation_chars.py`` including
fixup for r9253: add quote pair for Old Hungarian.
