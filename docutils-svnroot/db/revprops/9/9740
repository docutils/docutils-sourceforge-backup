Do not include INFO-level messages in XML writer functional test.

The functional tests for "docutils_xml" and for "pseudoxml" also test
the generation of INFO-level messages by setting `report_level: 1`.

This prevents use of the test output for the XML parser round-trip test:

* with `report_level: 1`, the original system_messages are preserved
  and new messages are generated for unreferenced targets :(

* with the default `report_level: 2`, the original system_messages are
  filtered out by the FilterMessages transform :(

-> Don't generate INFO-level messages in the XML writer test.
   (INFO-level messages are still tested with the "pseudoxml" writer.)
END
