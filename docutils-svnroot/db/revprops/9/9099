Fix handling of UTF-16 encoded source without trailing newline.

Decoding a UTF-16 encoded source with BOM after auto-detection of the
encoding failed.
The newline normalization in `docutils.FileInput.read()`
produced invalid UTF-16 because it added one byte
(binary ASCII newline).

Postponing the newline normalization after the decoding step solves
this problem.
