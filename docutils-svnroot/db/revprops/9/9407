Use "console_scripts" entry points instead of tools/rst2*.py scripts.

Update the installation of command line tools to modern standards:

Do not install scripts from the ``tools/`` directory into the binary
path. Instead, tell the installer to create and install ``rst2*``
console scripts from "entry point" definitions using functions
in `docutils.core`.

Cf. [feature-requests:88] and [patches:186].
