Move MathML tree simplification from `mrow.close()` to `parse_latex_math()`.

Do not open a new `<mrow>` (only to remove it afterwards)
for commands like ``\sqrt{3 +1}`` (LaTeX macro takes one argument
but `<sqrt>` node accepts a group).

Note: The replacement of `mrow` by a single child node remains
in the `mrow.close()` method, because we don't know in forehand
whether there is only one child.
