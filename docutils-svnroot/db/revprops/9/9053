Explicitly import `docutils.readers.doctree` sub-module.

Importing a sub-package (here docutils.readers) does not ensure
all of its modules are imported as well.

Therefore, test_publisher.py failed when run as stand-alone script
(while the test suite for some reason still finished without failure).

Flake8 complains about an unused import when accessing the sub-module
via its parent (i.e. as `readers.doctree`).

Thanks to Adam Turner for the report.
