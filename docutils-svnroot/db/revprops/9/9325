New functions for use as `rst2*` "console_scripts entry points".

The new functions allow the installation of `rst2*` command line scripts
via standard `entry points`__ instead of the current "scripts" list in
``setup.py`` after a transition period (cf. [feature-requests:#88]).

+ Works also for Windows.
+ Allows shorter command names (drop the extension), already in use
  in Debian and Ubuntu.
