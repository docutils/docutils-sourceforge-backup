Doctree documentation: make documentation more concise.

Don't put element "Details" into a separate subsection
but just after a short element definition.

Do not repeat descriptions from the "details" list
in plain text description.

+ Less overhead and less scrolling in both, source and HTML.

+ A longer free-text description can move below the "details"
  field-list making it more prominent and the overall structure of
  element sections more uniform.
END
