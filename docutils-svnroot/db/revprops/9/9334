Prefer Unix style line endings

I had inadvertently committed two files with Windows style 'CRLF'
(``\r\n``) line endings. This commit changes 
``docutils/test/conftest.py`` and ``.gitattributes`` to use Unix
style 'LF' (``\n``) endings.

We additionally specify that Unix style line endings are only
enforced in the ``docutils`` directory, as there are around 20 files
in the sandbox that use Windows style line endings, and I don't want
to change these at the moment.
END
