Fix ``punctuation_chars`` regeneration for tests

Unicode version 7.0 introduced U+2E42, "DOUBLE LOW-REVERSED-9 QUOTATION
MARK", in the Ps category. This codepoint doesn't have a pair
corresponding to it in the Pe category, breaking the assumptions in 
the ``openers`` and ``closers`` strings. The only usages I have been
able to identify are in Old Hungarian, where the character does not
seem to have been used as a quotation mark, so the concept of an
opening character and corresponding closing character do not easily
fit. As the simplest fix to allow tests to pass following
regeneration of the ``punctuation_chars`` file without manual editing,
we remove the U+2E42 character from the Ps category.
