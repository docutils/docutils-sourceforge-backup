Use `unquote()` instead of `url2pathname()` to unquote image URIs.

Simplify the unquoting of the path segment of an image URI.

`url2pathname` also converts the path delimiters to the system default
and does some additional replacements under Windows which is not required
for the Docutils HTML or LaTeX writers.

Fixes [bugs: #493]
