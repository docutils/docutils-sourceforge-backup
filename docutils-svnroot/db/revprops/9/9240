Refactor HTMLTranslator initialization and parts setup.

Use utils.xml_declaration().

Don't write charset (encoding) declaration if the intended output encoding
is not known.

Copy "meta" part content into "head" in `depart_document()`
(i.e. after collecting all items).
Obsoletes auxiliary method `add_meta()`. Remove it.

Changes to the HTML output (no space character before closing tag of XML
declaration, order of metadata elements) don't affect the HTML semantics,
styling, and rendering.
