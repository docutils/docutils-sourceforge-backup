Announce change to "refname" doctree element handling.

In Docutils 1.0, we will
keep case information of in "refname" attributes the Document Tree
and remove the "name" attribute of the `<reference>` element.

* As before, resolving cross-references for hyperlinks, footnotes, and citations ignores case.

* Custom "unknown_reference_resolvers" (added by 3rd party code, e.g., the MaoinMoin wiki)
  have access to the original casing of the reference name without the need for a separate attribute.
END
