One more Document Tree documentation review.

Rephrase and reformat for more brevity and clarity.
Fix typos, add crosslinks.

Less gaudy colors in the element hierarchy diagram.

Make the "Element Reference" introduction a sub-section,
so it turns up in the local ToC.

Update analogies to HTML (now referring to HTML5 rsp. the "living standard").
Fix analogy to `<h1>` to `<h6>`: these mark titles (headings), not sections.

Reduce redundancy: Only list including "Parameter Entities" if not
implied by the element category).

Update description of `<line-block>` (it used to be a
sort of literal-block but is is now rather a plain list,
cf. docs/dev/rst/alternatives.html#syntax-for-line-blocks).

Small section for "placeholder" parameter entities.

Move the description of "Pseudo-XML" and the "Names and identifiers"
section content to a new "Glossary" section.

Bibliography entry for docutils.dtd.
