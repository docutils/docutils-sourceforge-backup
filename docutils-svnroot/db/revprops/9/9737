xml-parser: test and fix handling of invalid input

Gracefully handle invalid attributes and text inserts:
Just generate (invalid) nodes without complaining.

With, e.g., `docutils --parser=xml myfile.xml`, the document tree
is validated by the `universal.Validate` transform by default.

Nodes returned from `parse_elememt()` can be easily validated
via their `validate()` method.

+ Allows parsing XML documents with "extended" document model
  for special applications.
+ Allows for cleanup operations between parsing and validation.
+ Simpler implementation (no duplicating of the reporting framework
  of the validator).
