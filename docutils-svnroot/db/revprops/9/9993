Revise output file path configuration setting.

The command-line usage pattern will change in Docutils 1.0 (cf. RELASE-NOTES).
In preparation, the "output" setting was introduced in Docutils 0.20.
As command line option, "--output" is a suitable name, however,
in a wider context, "output" is ambiguous and rather associated with the
actual output than the path to the output file.

Provide `settings.output_path` as "canonical" setting and
`--output` and `--output-path` as command line options.

Let `core.Publisher.set_destination()` synchronize `settings.output_path` with
the legacy settings `settings.output`, and `settings._destination`.
If the `destination_path` argument is specified, it overrides all three
settings and conflicting settings no longer raise an Error.

Use "settings.output_path" instead of the legacy settings in utils, transforms,
and writers.

Fix type hint for "destination" function argument in `Publisher.set_destination()`
(cf. the docstring of `publish_programatically()`).
