Use a simpler algorithm to generate char lists

The current algorithm checks each codepoint at least once, and when
``cp_max`` is ``None``, it checks all used characters twice. This
combines the two loops and stores the results of the call to
``unicodedata``.

Also remove the text about "wide" builds of Python, since PEP 393
and Python 3.3, all builds of Python carry support for the full
Unicode space.
