Doctree validation: fix check of `authors` content.

The `authors` element has a complex content model that cannot be
represented with the data-structure used in `Element.content_model`:

    (author, organization?, address?, contact?)+

Use specific method in `nodes.authors` to repeatedly test a
simplified content model description until all children are handled.
