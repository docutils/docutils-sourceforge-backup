Refactor HTML4 writer tests.

New test script "test_html4css1.py":
Split basic output tests (which happen to use the "fragment" returned
by `publish_parts()` to get the interesting part of the output)
from other tests of `publish_parts()`

Really test all returned parts in "test_html4css1_parts.py".

Cf. "Refactor HTML5 writer tests".
