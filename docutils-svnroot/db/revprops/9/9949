Add internal source and line attributes to more nodes.

The rST parser now also adds internal source and line attributes to
`<compound>`, `<container>`, `<sidebar>`, `<topic>`, `<line_block>`,
and `<line>` nodes.

Based on a pull request by Rob Taylor (on the github mirror) but adding
source and line info instead of the "raw" line number to account for
source parts included with the "include" directive,
also fixing line blocks (both directive and via line-block syntax),
and adding a test case.

See also [feature-requests:#41].
