Reset not only `_roles` but also `_directives` cache dictionary.

Clean the global caches to ensure predictable test results.
(There were additional warnings for undefined directive and
role names under Windows. These were suppressed due to other
tests adding canonical names to the cache under Linux.)

Add additional warnings to the expected output samples.

Registering directives at test module level no longer works.
Move `register_directive()` call to the test function.
