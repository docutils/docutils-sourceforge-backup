Documentation revision.

Use `<...>` notation for Document Tree elements
(similar to the [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML)).

Format RELEASE NOTES for more consistency.

Less section nesting in "config" doc.
The `<h6>` section headings came out in smaller font size that the main text
with the standard firefox and chromium style sheets.

Small fixes and additions.
