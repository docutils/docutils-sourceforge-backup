Test and fix `publish_parts()` with the LaTeX writer.

New test module for the LaTeX writer "parts" interface.

Make `writers.latex2e.Writer.assemble_parts()` idempotent
The `assemble_parts()` method adds newlines to "head" parts for better formatting
of the output file. However, is called in `translate()` and again by
publish_parts(), leading to spurious double trailing newlines.

Use super() when calling methods from the parent class.

Use f-strings
