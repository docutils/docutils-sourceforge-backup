Fix running of individual test (first batch).

After test refactoring, test scripts failed with ImportError
unless started from the "test root" ``docutils/test/``.

Prepend the "docutils root" to the Python library path
so we import the local `docutils` and `test` packages,
ignoring an eventually installed Docutils package.

Set executable bit where this was missing.

Also:
  Use "pathlib" instead of "os.path" for self-documenting path manipulations.

  Remove duplicate ``import unittest`` statements.
END
