Refactor "Include" directive class.

Disentangle actions and simplify interface of auxiliary methods.

`Include.run()` sets up instance attributes and calls helper functions
to read the file content and process it according to the options.
(Helper methods depend on setup in `run()`.)

Input sanity checks (too long lines and circular inclusions) are only
required when when inserting the file content into the "input_lines" of
the calling parser (which did these checks on the other "input_lines"
before starting to parsing it).

Adapt formatting.

Adapt tests.

Use shorter URL to the "include" directive documentation.
