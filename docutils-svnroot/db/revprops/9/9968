Doctree documentation revision.

Update documentation regarding the "colwidth" attribute handling.
and the included `Exchange Table Model`.

Unify name use.

Revise/fix hyperlinks.

Improve wording/formatting.

Correct description of the "names" doctree element attribute:

Under specific circumstances, an element may have both,
``names`` and ``dupnames`` attributes.
This is intentional to provide a means to solve conflicts in
implicit hyperlink targets (e.g. two section headings with similar title),
e.g. ::

  My Title
  --------

  .. _my title:

  my title
  --------

  `My title`_ links to the second section.
END
