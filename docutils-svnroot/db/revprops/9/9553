"reStructuredText Markup Specification" revision.

Add cross links.
Purge trailing spaces.
"semantic wrapping"

More consistent markup:
 * "quote" directive and role names,
 * wrap doctree elements in <angle brackets>,
 * *emphasize* important terms,

Use a field-list for data tables
(doctree elements, see also, start/end strings, ...).

Rework description of document title and
bibliographic fields (`frontmatter` transforms).

Drop "New in Docutils 0.x" for versions <0.11 (older than 10 years).

Add list of implemented inline-compatible directives
to "substitution definition" section.
Move their description and examples to the "directives" document.
Comment out the "styles" example.

Shorten/correct "Standalone Hyperlinks" section. (Docutils
recognizes relative URIs as long as there is a "scheme" part.)

Sort references (hyperlink targets) by target document,
then alphabetically.
END
