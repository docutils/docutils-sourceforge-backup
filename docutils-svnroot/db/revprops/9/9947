"include" directive: handle duplicate names and IDs in sub-documents

When the :parser: option is specified, the included file is parsed
into a dummy `<document>` and children are appended.
Let internal bookkeeping attributes reference the main document
equivalents, so that element names and IDs share a namespace
with the including document.
END
