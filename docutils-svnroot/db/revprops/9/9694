Doctree validation: declare valid element children (part 2).

Declare valid children and valid number of children for all
document tree elements.

Requires some re-ordering (define sub-elements first so that
the class can be used in the content declaration of the parent).

New element category class `nodes.PureTextElement` for nodes that do
not accept Inline elements, only text (was a TODO comment).

Add declarations for valid attributes of table elements defined
in the Exchange Table Model but not used/supported by Docutils.
END
