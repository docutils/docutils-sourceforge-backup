Provide a generic Translator base class for writers.

Move the `uri2path()` method there.
Use it in LaTeX and HTML writers to reduce code duplication and
unify the handling of image URI references.

Using `uri2path()` in the ODT writer would be a backwards-incompatible
change: The ODT writer expects relative image paths to be relative to
the **source** directory. Announce upcoming change for the ODT writer.
