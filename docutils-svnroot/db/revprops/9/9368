Add output encoding error handler to the parts provided by all writers.

The new generic part "errors" returned by default
contains the `output_encoding_error_handler` setting,
which may make-or-break encoding ``parts['whole']``.

Allows use of `core.publish_parts()` to get the document as `str`,
post-process it and encode with user configurated encoding and
encoding-error handler.
