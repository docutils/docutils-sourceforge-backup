Only extempt sample *.txt files from "trailing whitespace" git pre-commit check.

Mask trailing whitespace in test_latex2e.py.

Replace the generic extemption for '*.txt' with '*pseudoxml.txt'.
(Expected output from the "pseudoxml" writer which has trailing whitespace
by design.)

Also simplify rule after ``prest`` moved to the attic.
