New wrapper module for "CommonMark" parsers.

The parser names 'commonmark' and 'markdown' now
select the first locally installed parser
from a list of compatible 3rd-party parser packages
(pycmark, myst, and recommonmark).

The parsers return slightly different doctrees.
This should not matter for HTML output but leads to false
negatives with the "include" directive test. Therefore the test
case now specifies "recommonmark".

The "pycmark" parser defines transformations to comlete nested parsing
and clean up non-standard nodes. These transformations must also
be run when including a document fragment.
