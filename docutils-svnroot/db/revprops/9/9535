Base MathML element classes on xml.etree.

Use `xml.etree` for a more standard compatible implementation of
MathML element classes.

`xml.etree` comes with methods to represent XML elements,
to convert to XML (since Python 3.9 also indented XML),
search for elements, iterate over nodes etc.

The new module adds an interface to the requirements of latex2mathml:

* Simpler instantiation
  - tag name taken from class name,
  - attribute names are normalized to lowercase
    (allows 'CLASS' for 'class'),
  - attribute values may be specified as numbers, booleans, or strings
    (converted to `str` before storing).

* "internal" attributes to store a reference to the parent element
  and the number of expected children.

* "appending" to and "closing" an element returns the new "active node"
  (insertion point).

* Remove redundant `<mrow>` elements when closing.

* toxml() by default returns a Unicode `str` (not `bytes`).
