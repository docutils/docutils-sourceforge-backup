Document translation error for "admonition".

The use in rST is not a light "reproof", "reprimand", or "exhortation".
Rather something in the line with "advisory", "advise", "remark",
"warning notice".

We look for an umbrella term for the specific admonitions
(attention, caution , danger, error, hint, important, note,
tip, warning) and similar block elements.
