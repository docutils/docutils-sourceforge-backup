Revise image reading in HTML writers.

The HTML writers read image files for embedded images
and to determine the size of images that should be scaled.

* Use urllib to parse image URI (support for "file:" scheme).

* Warn, if scaling fails because the image cannot be read.

Adapt "record dependencies" test to suppress warning
if PIL is not installed.
