LaTeX to MathML: generate simpler MathML trees, fix `\cfrac`.

MathML Core defines more global attributes as MathML 3.
So we can now get rid of some `<mstyle>` wrappers and attach
styling attributes directly to the to-be-styled elements.

This also fixes

* a misattachment of expressions following continued fractions,
* styling of "smallmatrix" in Chromium,
END
