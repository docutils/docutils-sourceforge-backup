Adapt path before reading image file.

In order to work in the output document, relative image URIs relate
to the output directory. To determine the image size from the image or
embed the image, the writer must access the image file at build time.

The change ensures that the same URI can be used for images referenced
in the output document and embedded images also when CWD and output
directory differ.
