Smartquotes optimizations part 3.

Skip regexp substitutions if there are no quotes to "educate".

Together, the optimizations bring down the time spent on the smartquotes transformation from
20% to 10% of the total rst2html5 conversion time.
(Tested with py-spy on `builthtml` of the Docutils docs directory.)
