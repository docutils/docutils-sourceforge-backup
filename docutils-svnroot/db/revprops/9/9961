Store attribute values with datatype "yesorno" as `bool` values.

Use `bool` instead of `int` to store values of "yesorno" attributes in
Python doctree element instances.
This is the "natural" choice for "yesorno" and restores consistency
with the validating function `nodes.validate_yesorno()`.

In XML and pseudoxml output, the value is serialized as "0" or "1"
for backwards compatibility.
