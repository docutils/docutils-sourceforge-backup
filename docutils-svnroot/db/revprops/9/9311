Refactor latex writer tests.

Define default test settings as class attribute.

Use separate test functions for different settings instead of
running all sub-test from one function.

Simplify naming.

Add test for "use_bibtex" setting (will be fixed in next commit).

Add stub for testing `core.publish_parts()` with the "latex" writer.
(Currently publish_parts does not work with "latex".)
END
