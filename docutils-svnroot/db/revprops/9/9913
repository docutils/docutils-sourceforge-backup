Refactor HTML5 writer tests.

New test script "test_html5_polyglot.py":
Split basic output tests (which happen to use the "fragment" returned
by `publish_parts()` to get the interesting part of the output)
from other tests of `publish_parts()`

Really test all returned parts in "test_html5_polyglot_parts.py".
Fill in parts that are built out of other parts in a helper function
instead of pruning parts.
Add test cases for input that goes to special parts.

Disable default style sheet ("stylesheet_path" setting) by for tests
not requiring a stylesheet.
END
