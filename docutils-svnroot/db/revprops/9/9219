Simplify/fix LaTeX character encoding handling.

Do not call "inputenc" if the "output-encoding" setting is 'utf-8'.
(UTF-8 is the default encoding for LaTeX2e since 2018.)

Do not call "inputenc" if the "output-encoding" setting is 'unicode':
Docutils returns a `str` instance and does not know which encoding will
be used when the output is written to a file or passed to LaTeX.
