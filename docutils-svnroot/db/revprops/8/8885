Node.traverse() returns a list again to restore backwards compatibility.

Although the documented API only promised an "iterable" as return
value, the implementation returned a list.
Because Sphinx < 4.0.0 relies on this and Sphinx < 3.5.4 places no upper
limit to the Docutils dependency, this led to many errors "in the wild".

Fixes bug #431.

New method Node.findall(): like Node.traverse() but returns an iterator.
