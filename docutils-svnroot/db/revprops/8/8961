Cosmetic changes.

* Place module level "dunders" before imports (as advised in PEP 8).

* Add () after function names in module docstring so that pydoc can
  crate links in HTML output.

* Fix/clarify some docstrings.

* Remove (outcommented) @functools.total_ordering from VersionInfo:
  it did not work (tests fail without __le__() method).
