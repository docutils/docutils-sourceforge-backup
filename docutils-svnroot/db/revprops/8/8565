Limit length of input lines and substitution expansion.

Mitigate the danger of DoS attacs using
specially crafted rST input (cf. bug #381).

The default value of 10 000 characters should suffice for
legitimate use cases (e.g. long paragraphs in auto-wrapping editors
or extensive creative use of substitutions).

Applications processing untrusted rST might wish to lower this
limitation (together with other safety measures described in
docs/howto/security.txt).

Unsupervised processing of untrusted rST input should always
be safeguarded with limits on processing time and memory use.
