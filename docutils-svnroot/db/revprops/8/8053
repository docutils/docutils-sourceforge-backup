Update smartquotes: 

* use the rules of the `Imprimerie nationale` as french default 
  (full NBSP inside guillemets).
* do not invert “ and ’ in en-UK: expect British authors to use 
  u0027	APOSTROPHE for primary quotes and " for secondary quotes in the source.
  Set ``--smart-quotes=alt`` (or use en-UK-x-altquot) for inversion
  by `smartquotes`.
* do not call ``educate_backticks`` in the SmartQuotes transform: 
  backticks have a special meaning in rST.
