Speed up Node.next_node() ...

... by not creating a full list of following nodes in the process.

Although the documented API of Node.traverse() only promises an "iterable"
as return value, the implementation returned a list up to v. 0.15.
Some 3rd party code still relies on this (e.g. Sphinx as of 2019-09-07).
Therefore, Node.traverse() returns a list until this is sorted out.
