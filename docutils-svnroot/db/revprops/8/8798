math2html: Prefer STIX fonts for formulas.

STIX is free, widely supported, and comprehensive.
(On the downside: it is considerably smaller than DejaVu:
no problem with Chromium/Chrome but in Firefox a larger font-size
might be advised.)

Work around bugs/problems in STIX:
"medium mathematical space" is too wide,
"vertical line" glyphs leave gaps when stacked,
upright integrals provide better alignment of limits.
