Implement feature request #40 Option to embed images as data URI.

If the new "embed_image" configuration setting is true, the image
can be read from the local file system, and its MIME type can be
determined, it is base64 encoded and included as a data URI.

TODO:

* Add an "embed" option to the "image" directive to allow embedding
  of individual images?

* Use direct inlinging for SVG in HTML5?
END
