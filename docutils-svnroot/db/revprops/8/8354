py3: Replace 'sys.maxint' with 'sys.maxsize'

From the Python 3 release docs [1]:

  The sys.maxint constant was removed, since there is no longer a limit
  to the value of integers. However, sys.maxsize can be used as an
  integer larger than any practical list or string index. It conforms to
  the implementation’s “natural” integer size and is typically the
  same as sys.maxint in previous releases on the same platform (assuming
  the same build options).
