MathML: simplify node class interface, fix accent handling.

Instantiating functions for "math" class and descendents handle all
positional arguments as children/data and named arguments as attributes.

Set "accent" argument for <mover> according to LaTeX macro.
Influences dropping of i-dot and size of top character, defaults to
"automatic" (MathML 3) or "false" (MathML Core Draft).
