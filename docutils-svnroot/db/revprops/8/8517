Experimental HTML5/CSS3 style-sheet inspired by Edward Tufte's layout design.

Use media query to determine screen width and better use it.
-> Better support for sidebars,
-> Footnotes in the margin (if space permits).

Work in progress.

Block colouring is used as a development aide,
the final version will have a uniform background colour.
