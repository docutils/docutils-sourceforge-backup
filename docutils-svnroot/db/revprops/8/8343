Drop support for Python 3.4

This doesn't involve a whole lot of changes, but references to Python
3.3 and 3.4 (plus some to the already removed Python 2.6) are removed
and 'setup.py' is updated as necessary. This has already been agreed
upon, as noted in RELEASE-NOTES.txt:

  Docutils 0.15.x is the last version supporting Python 2.6, 3.3, and 3.4.
  Docutils 0.16 is compatible with Python versions 2.7 and 3.5 to 3.7.
