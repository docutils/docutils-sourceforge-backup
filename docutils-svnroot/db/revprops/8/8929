Documentation update.

* Small clarification in the rST spec.

* Move detailled description of alternative ways to install for
  development from the "Docutils policies" to the "repository"
  documentation.

  We don't need to go into details in the "policies" document
  and "edible installs" are also useful for casual contributors
  or power-users.

* Update links and optional dependencies in the README,
  use terminology from PEP 621.
  Move the sandbox snapshot download doc to the sandbox README.
