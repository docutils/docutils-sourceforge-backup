HTML5: Improve accessibility of section headings.

Mark the internal back-refences from section headings to the ToC
with DPub-ARIA role "doc-backref".

Use "aria-level" instead of a class argument value for section headings
with nesting level > 6 (for level 1 to 6, the level is determined by
the HTML tag).
Mind that in HTML5, heading level 1 is reserved for the document title
and section headings start with level 2.

Add functional test sample for deeply nested sections.
Merge functional tests for additonal HTML5 features.
