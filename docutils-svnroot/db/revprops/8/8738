MathML: Use large operators and fix alignment in "math" blocks.

Set displaystyle="true"  and class="align" for the outer ``<mtable>``¹
in math blocks.

¹ The "mtable"-wrapper is used to support multi-line formulas
  similar to the "align" environment in the "amsmath" LaTeX package.

Add CSS to left-align the table cells in "align"-emulating mtables.

Fixes part of bug #407.
