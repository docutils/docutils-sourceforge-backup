Fix bug #424 Wrong circular inclusion detection.

The current heuristic for detection of circular includes
fails with nested parsing. Line numbering differs in nested
state-machines, inclusions don't show up in the parent, if
a view is detached (e.g. for table cell content).

The new heuristic uses a "magic" comment instead of line numbers
to keep a log of recursive inclusions.

Add a test case for a false positive and a case for
too late detection in parsed includes.

Adapt tests to (irrelevant) side effects of the patch.
