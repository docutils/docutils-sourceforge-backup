Fix tests of syntax highlighting with Pygments >=2.5.

Pygments changed the default Python lexer from "python2"
to "python3" which results in classification of
"print" as "name builtin" instead of "keyword".

Specifying "python3" in the test samples ensures the same output
with Pygments 2.4 and 2.5.
