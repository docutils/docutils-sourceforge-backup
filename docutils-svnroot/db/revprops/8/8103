Remove dead links to the Gmane web interface.

The mail to news interface and mail archive "Gmane" went down 2016 and is
only partially restored. http://home.gmane.org/2016/08/29/next-steps-gmane/

Remove dead links to the web interface and add links to the
mail archives at Sourceforge.

TODO: There are still dead links to specific messags in 
      Bugs.txt, todo.txt and alternatives.txt

Thanks to Luke Plant for reporting the issue.
