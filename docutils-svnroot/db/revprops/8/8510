html5 writer: wrap image elements in <p> unless inline or in figure.

In HTML, <img> is by default an inline element.
The rST "image" directive generates block-level elements
(unless used in a "substitution" directive).

Wrapping in a container enables more advanced CSS styling.
A paragraph as wrapper fits well with Docutils wrapping
inline content in paragraphs by default.

No change for the "html4css1" writer (ensure backwards compatibility).
