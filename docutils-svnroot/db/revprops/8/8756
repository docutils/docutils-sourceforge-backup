MathML: remove unrequired <mrow>s, support more commands.

Support additional commands from the AMS math-guide.

Remove <mrow>, if it is single child and the parent inferres an mrow
or if it has only one child element.

tex_number(): do not return trailing delimiter.

Use class "mathscr" instead of hard-codes font name for \mathscr.
END
