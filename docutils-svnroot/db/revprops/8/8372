py3: Wrap 'foo.keys()', 'zip(foo, bar') in 'list'

In Python 3, 'dict.keys()', 'zip' and 'map' no longer return a list but
rather types 'dict_keys', 'zip' and 'map', respectively. You can't
append to these types nor can you delete from them while in a loop.  The
simple solution to both issues is to wrap things in 'list'.
