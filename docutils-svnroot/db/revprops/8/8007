Remove (already commented) "source date epoch" setting.

The "use_source_date_epoch" config setting was rejected by the people
proposing to support the source-date-epoch environment variable.
An eventual support will not use it.
See https://reproducible-builds.org/specs/source-date-epoch/
and https://sourceforge.net/p/docutils/patches/132/
END
