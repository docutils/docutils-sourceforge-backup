Fix #423 Code blocks in sidebars cause LaTeX errors.

Do not use the "alltt" enviromnent in sidebars.

In admonitions and system-messages, "alltt" is used
unless the "legacy-class-functions" setting is True.
(Admonitions and system-messages are implemented as
environments since rev 8479.)

Thanks to Clément Pit-Claudel for reporting.
