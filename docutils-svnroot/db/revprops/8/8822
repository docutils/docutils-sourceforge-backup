Simplify LaTeX writer code.

visit_inline() and depart_inline() can be called unconditionally
by other visitors: the "classes" argument is present on all doctree
nodes and they don't add LaTeX code when "classes" is empty.

This is an extension of ``1-visit-inline.patch`` by Clément Pit-Claudel
from patch #183.
