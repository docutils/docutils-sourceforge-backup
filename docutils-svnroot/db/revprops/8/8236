Definition list terms must not use "rawsource" attribute for escaping.

Remove implementation of escaping the classifier delimiter in
definition list terms that relies on the "rawsource" attribute.
This is not safe (rawsource is only for information and debugging purposes).

A proper fix can be done with null-escaped text in Text nodes.
