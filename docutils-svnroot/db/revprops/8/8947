Fixup last commit.

Changes to the DocutilsTestSupport in commit r8946 led to
bug #442 "Tests fail on master when recommonmark isn't installed".

Fix by making the tests more self-containded and robust.

Use generic "markdown" parser (if available) for cross-parser inclusion
in test_rst/test_directives/test_include.py.

Test for correct resolution of directives.parser_name('recommonmark')
in test_recommonmark/test_misc.py.
