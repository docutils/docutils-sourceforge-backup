- Fixed stupid bug that made last change a no-op.
- Explicitly made 'DOCUTILSCONFIG' ignore empty path items.
- Refactored `test_settings.ConfigFileTests`:

  - Centralized reading of config files and combining of multiple
    setting dicts.

    - Subclassed with a class that runs the very same tests but sets
      `os.environ['DOCUTILSCONFIG']` instead of reading files directly.

  - Added test method that reads no files at all, for completeness.
  - Improved diff display in `compare_output` (order & trailing
    newlines).
  - Fixed bug in `test_old_and_new`: it used 'old' expected settings
    (which are surely the same as 'one') but read the 'one' config file.
    Assuming it's a cut-and-paste typo, changed to read 'one' file.
