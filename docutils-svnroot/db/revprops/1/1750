checking in the initial version of my lout writer.
Please beware, there is a reason this is in the sandbox.
The code is *very* ugly (cleanup is scheduled right after functionality) and incomplete;
lots of methods are still copied from the html writer (because this gives me a visual
hint of what is missing, when I load the processed output).
However, I can already reasonably process my largish target document, so if you want to
experiment with it and have a rough idea of what it will look like, feel free.
Of course, there is no distutils yet.  You have to copy or symlink it in your writers
package if you want to play with it.  However, the front-end in tools/ is working
(assuming you do install the module).
