Updated method for handling MoinMoin markup functions. Now create functors for each type of markup that should be handled by MoinMoin.

Bug fixes for inline image handling. Handle case where the image doesn't exist as an attachment.

Also updated to handle other types of inline (embedded python files, etc.)
