DocFactory 0.3 (2004/05/07)
  * Changed the **Project Settings** dialog: The new version allows
    you to edit docutils.conf-files in a more flexible way.  You can
    add/edit/remove any kind of sections/options/values by yourself.
    As more and more docutils settings become available, this seems
    to be a much better solution than the former dialog.  To put it
    into a nutshell:  DocFactory is prepared for the new Docutils
    configuration file format now.  (I know, it's not that new
    anymore ...)
