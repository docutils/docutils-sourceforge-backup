* use docutils.{Parser,Writer}Extension baseclasses
* consistently use `extends` attribute
* split writer handling into two classes, one for each writer
* moved settings_spec from its own SettingExtension to
  the WriterExtension it applies to
* moved KeyExtension contents to KeyRole ParserExtension

Now we have four classes: One ParserExtension (KeyRole), two
WriterExtensions (KeyNode{HTML,LaTeX}Support), and one auxiliary class
(KeyNode) which is not recognized by the Docutils extension system.
