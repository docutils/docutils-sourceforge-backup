Fixed handling unicode characters (probably not the best way, still need to look into existing Python facilities).

Added support for the moinmoin link scheme "inline:". This allows inline images either through a link or through the ".. image" rst syntax.

Cleaned up a few of the routines.

Tested with 1.2.4 and everything seems to be working well.
