Fixed a security error where through the rst parser any file readable by the webserver could be accessed. This fix is pretty ugly but I don't know of a better way.

The docutils classes FileInput and FileOutput are overwritten with dummy versions.

All docutils imports are scanned and have a dummy open and urllib2 added. All docutils imports also get a custom __import__ function so that any dynmically imported modules also get dummy open and urllib2.

Added feature that counts the number of imports for a document stops importing after 20. 20 seemed like a reasonable guess. I really have no idea how many to make this.

END
