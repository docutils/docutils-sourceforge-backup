Fixed use_latex_docinfo to always show the titlepage.

Forced \date{} and \author{} to be emitted at all times, to avoid latex's
default (the date latex processed the file, which is never interesting for us;
perhaps using the date *docutils* processed the file would make sense if
--date is given?).

END
