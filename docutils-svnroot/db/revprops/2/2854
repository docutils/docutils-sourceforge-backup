Re-fixed rendering of admonitions in HTML to unify generated HTML of
pre-defined and user-defined admonitions.

This fix also avoids paragraph-compacting like this::

    <div class="attention">
    <p class="admonition-title first">Attention!</p>
    Directives at large.</div>

(Note that the second paragraph has no <p> tags.)

END
