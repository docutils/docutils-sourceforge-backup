Fixed adding title and subtitle to document. Doesn't blindly add the h2/h3 tags, only adds them is the title and subtitle attributes are present.

Changed the newline replacement in visit_reference so that a newline is replaced with a space rather than nothing. This keeps spacing in a string with a newline.

END
