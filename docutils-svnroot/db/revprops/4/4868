* Implementing processing pending transforms according to priority.
  This simplifies the sectnum processing since it can assume the
  contents directive has not been processed yet.
* Added the -D docinfo-levels option.
* Changed the documentation to show the -D options with hyphens ("-")
  instead of underscores ("_") separting words.
* The sectnum:: directive now processes starting from its containing
  section, rather than from the top of the DOM tree.
