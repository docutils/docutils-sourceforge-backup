* Parse now parses a string rather than reading from a file.
* Refactored to remove all dependencies upon main::
* Added tag method.
* Added methods based on the docutils.dtd structure:
  * takes_body_elts, takes_inline_elts: true if a DOM object can have
    body/inline elements as children, respectively.
  * is_body_elt, is_inline_elt: true if a DOM object can be a child of
    one for which takes_body_elts/takes_inline_elts returns true,
    respectively.
