Removed handler for failed import of urllib2.  It was added in r1775
because it "was causing problems on SourceForge (``libssl.so.2``
unavailable?)" [log], but it works now on both SF.net and BerliOS, so
there's no reason to handle this case anymore, I think.  I didn't put
the import at the top of the module though because we still want to
degrade gracefully if it's broken.
END
