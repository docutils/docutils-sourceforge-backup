* Added hyphens to the following -D options: entry-attr, include-ext,
  include-path, nest-inline, perl-path, row-attr, table-attr.
* Added the following -D options: file-insertion-enabled,
  ignore-include-errs, raw-enabled.
* Fixed a bug where explicit targets were not permitted within an
  embedded url (e.g., 'reference <#explicit-target>').
* Don't consider targets defined on the same source/line number to be
  duplicate targets (can happen with multiply-included files).
* Fixed the checking for inconsistent title levels to be more robust.
* Keep an @INCLUDES array to keep track of the include stack.
* Added a :head: option for raw:: directive.
* Added a :prefix-title: option for sectnum:: directive.
