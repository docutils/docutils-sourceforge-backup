* Added ancestors array so that writers can determine their context
  when a DOM object has more than one "parent" (which can happen when
  a shallow copy occurs).
* Refactored to remove all dependencies upon main::
* Added the "title" class to title section that is kept because of -D
  keep-title-section.
