added link to Docutils sprint

I added a News section, where I put the link (to make it well
visible).  The Docutils home page can probably use such a news section
anyway; many open source projects have it.  I didn't tag the sprint
"news" with the current date because I think that would be confusing;
but we can change that when we have (longer) news entries that justify
having a date.  As always, feel free to improve.
