* Changed the semantics of "-W embed-stylesheet" and "-W stylesheet".
* Added "-W stylesheet2" option to specify a secondary embedded stylesheet.
* Changed default of -W field-limit to 14 from 15.
* Reworked so all the writer's annotations are in DOM's {_html} member.
* Reworked so that DOM's {attr} member is read-only; HTML attributes
  are all copied to {_html}{attr} member.
* Factored out much of the attribute handling into a GetAttr routine.
* Fixed output of literals embedded in literals.
