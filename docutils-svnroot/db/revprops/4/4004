- Changed the default bindings due to the explosion of new
  feature: we now have a prefix-map, which is bound to 'C-c p',
  so the 'C-x p XXXX' commands are all for the rst.el file
  functions.  I left a few bindings:

  * C-= is still there, because it is the single most useful
    command and it should be invoked with one key (you can get to
    it with 'C-c p a' too).

  * I moved 'C-M-{' to 'C-c n' or 'C-c p n' and did the same for
    the forward movement commands.

  * 'C-c C-l' and 'C-c C-r' have been kept, since they have a
    similar role than those bindings have in progmodes.

- I removed all the bindings from 'C-x ...' prefix map, since we
  should be using the mode-specific map, which is 'C-c ...'.  I'm
  also now using the mode-prefix-map variable, so people who have
  rebound theirs will get the benefits of their customization.

- Started defining some abbrevs, e.g. 'con' for ''.. contents::'

- Changed a lot of 'if's to 'when' and 'unless' clauses.

- I added a function to find the node within the section subtree
  where the cursor lives. This function is used to compute the
  desired location of point in the toc table, which fixes a bug
  with the cursor being off when there were missing nodes.

- The toc insertion now uses the insertion point to determine
  where to start rendering the TOC.  This fixes a problem with
  guessing the titles and subtitles and heuristically removing
  them, simplifies the rst-toc-insert function and this new
  choices automatically supports local tocs.

- Fixed the shifting functions to use markers, so that they can
  be used repeatedly with my repeat-repeatable-command advice.
  This just makes the functions more robust.

- Added an option to automatically fill on shifting a region left
  or right (this needs more work).
