* Initialize ANONYMOUS_TARGETS in init.

  confusion.
* Fixed the handling of inline literals in definition lists.
* Put a system message in the document rather than dying if a plug-in
  directive fails to compile.

  invariant.

  inline markup.
* Fixed an infinite loop that could come up if a line block started
  with two or more blank lines.

* Changed the calling sequence of
  Text::Restructured::Directive::arg_check to be able to check for
  either exact number of argumments or minimum number.

  Text::Restructured::Directive::parse_directive to be able to call
  arg_check and check_option_names.
* Removed Text::Restructured::Directive::no_args.
* Have include directive do nothing if the file is empty, as opposed
  to returning an empty paragraph.
* Added checks for the prefix and suffix options to the role directive
  to be sure they're formatted correctly.

  not a single paragraph.
