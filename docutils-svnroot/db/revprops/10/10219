LaTeX writer: write "label" commands for elements with "ids".

Fix [bugs:#503].

Currently, internal cross-references to most body elements (admonitions, lists,
block_quotes, container, compound, ...) fail, because the "ids"
attribute of these elements is ignored.

Calls `ids_to_labels()` for (almost) all elements that may have one or more IDs.

TODO:
* test/revise citations and footnotes
* class handling for image and list items
  (use DUclass environment or DUrole function?)
* Currently, there is no way to specify a target name or custom class for
  the "docinfo" in the rST source.
