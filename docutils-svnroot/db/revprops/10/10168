Drop the (faulty) "name" option of the "target-notes" directive.

Remove "name" from `TargetNotes.option_spec`.

The "target-notes" directive generates one footnote element per external target,
so it is unclear where a "name" attribute should go.

Up to now, the name was dropped by the "TargetNodes" transform and led to
an AssertionError in documents without external references
