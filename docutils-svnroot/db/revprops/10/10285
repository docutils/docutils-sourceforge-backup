Move LaTeX styling for "html-roles" definitions to docutils.sty.

The "standard definition file" "html-roles.txt" contained a "raw" directive
with LaTeX macros for the styling of the "semantic markup" roles added by
this file. This leads to WARNING messages, if applications disable the "raw"
directive for security reasons.

Move the definitions to the LaTex package/stylefile "docutils.sty" and
ensure that relevant definitions are loaded on demand.

Nice side effects:

* works also if any of the roles are defined via the "role" directive
* less overhead if just some of the roles are used.
END
