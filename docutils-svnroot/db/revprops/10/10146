Deprecate the `TransformSpec.unknown_reference_resolvers` hook chain.

`unknown_reference_resolvers` were introduced to support component-specific
resolving of unknown references. Ian Bicking's "Wiki.py" module in the sandbox
shows that a simple transform can be used for that task.
Removing the hook and its complex specification will simplify both,
API and code base without loss of functionality.

The only known use case is the MoinMoin wiki.¹
Versions <= 1.9 register a "resolver" function for "Wiki references".
MoinMoin 2.0 does not use the "unknown_reference_resolvers" hook;
MoinMoin 1.9 requires Python 2, so a removal will not affect
existing installations.

¹ The LaTeX writer uses a "resolver function" for BibTeX citation_references
  in Docutils 0.22 development and pre-release versions.
  It will be changed to use a transform in the next commit.
