Re-sort class definitions in nodes.py.

Move the definition of "special purpose elements" before all other
concrete DocTree elements.
Required for the fix to `transition.validate_position()` in the next commit
(most "special purpose elements" must be ignored when validating that
the transition is not first or last element of its parent).
END
