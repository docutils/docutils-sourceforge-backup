Fix problems with 3rd-party parsers.

Pass default settings to custom parser for included file.
When the "include" directive is used with a custom parser,
we must ensure the custom parser's default settings are present
in `document.settings`.

Fix error when determining the document metadata title from the
source path and the internal `source` attribute is ``None``.
