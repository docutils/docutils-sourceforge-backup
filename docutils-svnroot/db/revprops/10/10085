Test "clickable" image in a figure and fix LaTeX writer.

Add a "target" option to a "figure" directive in the standard.rst
functional test file to test handling and validation of an `<image>` wrapped
in a `<reference>` in a `<figure>`.

Fix the LaTeX writer's handling of images nested in a `<reference>`:

* Default to center-aligned images in a figure also if it is "clickable".
* Fix newlines in output of visit_image() and visit_reference().
* Add test cases to the LaTeX writer test.
END
