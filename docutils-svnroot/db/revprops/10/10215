LaTeX writer: set anchor for math-block with target/label.

The "hyperref" LaTeX package sets an anchor for hyperlinks to math blocks,
if they are numbered. The "math" directive generates unnumbered math blocks.
Prepend a `\phantomsection` to manually set an anchor so that hyperlinks
go to the right place.
