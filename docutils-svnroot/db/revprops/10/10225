Deprecate the "match_titles" argument of `states.RSTState.nested_list_parse()`.

`nested_list_parse()` is intended for second and subsequent items of lists
and list-like constructs, it does never match section titles.

The argument value was (mis)used in directive classes to check wheter a
`<topic>` or `<sidebar>` element can be returned.
This check is now replaced by testing for a valid parent node.
