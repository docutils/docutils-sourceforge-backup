Relax test for valid parents of topics or sidebars.

Raise error if the parent element belongs to a not-allowed parent class
instead of when the parent element is not in a supported parent class.
The difference is with uncategorized parent classes (like `node.Element`
or `sphinx.addnodes.only`). This allows for auxiliary wrappers during
the parsing step and fixes issues with the Sphinx "only" directive.
