Fix LaTeX docinfo handling of affiliation fields preceding author field.

With "use_latex_docinfo", the content of the bibliographic fields
"address", "contact", and "organization" is attached to the author name.

Reserve the first position for the author name instead of creating an
"author info" list without author if any of these fields appeares before
an "author" or "authors" field.
END
