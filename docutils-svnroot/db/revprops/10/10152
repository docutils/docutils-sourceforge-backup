Announce deprecation of `<target>` elements with content. Prepare "latex" writer.

The `<target>` element has 2 use cases:

a) as empty "body element" to provide a "name" attribute for the next
   body element (via the `references.PropagateTargets` transform)
   or to map a reference name to a "refid" or "refuri".

b) as "inline element" with text content to provide an anchor.

For use case b), the generic `<inline>` element is equally well suited.
Deprecation of the inline use simplifies the definition and validation
of `<target>` elements (only valid as empty block-level element).

Change `LaTeXTranslator.visit_inline()` to insert labels for the given node's IDs.
(Preparation for the future use of `<inline>` for inline anchors and generally
a good idea.)
