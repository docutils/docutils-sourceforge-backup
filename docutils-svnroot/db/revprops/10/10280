Fix "input_offset" in tables.

When parsing the cell content of grid tables and simple tables,
the "input_offset" passed to the nested parser was off by one line.

This led to wrong "lineno" and "content_offset" attributes in Directive
class instances and to wrong line numbers in system-messages.

Fixes bug #517.

TODO: the reported line numbers for CSV table content are still wrong.
