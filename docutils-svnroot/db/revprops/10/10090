Announce provision for SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH in Docutils 1.0.

If the environment variable `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH`_ is set, the "date"
directive and the timestamp inserted by the "datestamp"
configuration setting will use its value instead of the current time to
support "reproducible builds".

See [patches:#132] for the discussion.
