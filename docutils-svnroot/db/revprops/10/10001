Fix LaTeX section numbering

Translate section level 0 to LaTeX section level when suppressing automatic
section numbering by LaTeX. (LaTeX section levels may start at -1, 0, or 1.)

Don't modify the "PreambleCmds" class attribute.
This may lead to wrong output when several documents are converted in one
Python run. Fix the test cases where this wrong output slipped attention and
was quoted as expected output!

Augment the list of LaTeX documentclasses that provide "chapter"
sections.

Move section numbering configuration to `visit_section()`.
(It is only required if there is at least one section in the document.)
END
