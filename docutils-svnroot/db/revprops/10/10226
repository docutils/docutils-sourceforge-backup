rST parser: restore backwards compatibility of nested parsing.

* Keep document-wide title style hierarchy in nested parsing.

* Revert to using `document.memo.section_level` (required for nested parsing
  into a detached base node with document-wide title styles).

+ simpler logic
+ backwards compatible
- more bookkeeping effort
- mandating a document-wide section title style hierarchy is ill-suited for
  inclusion of rST blocks from external sources (e.g. extracted docstrings).
  See `sphinx.util.parsing.nested_parse_to_nodes()` for an alternative.

This should restore compatibility with Sphinx's "only" directive broken by [r10204].
