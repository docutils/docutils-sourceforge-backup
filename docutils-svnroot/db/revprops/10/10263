Future-proof the test for valid parents of topics or sidebars.

Test a "whitelist" of categories before the "blacklist"
to allow auxiliary elements belonging to several categories
(e.g. `nodes.Root` and `nodes.BodyElements`) as parents
of topics or sidebars.
This still gives uncategorized nodes the "benefit of daubt"
but supports properly categorized nodes as well.
