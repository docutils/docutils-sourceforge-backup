More detailled description of the restrictions on transition placement.

The formulation of the restrictions
"a transition may not begin a section or document" and
"a transition may not be at the end of a section or document"
is vague and inconsistent.

Add description of "invisible" elements that are ignored when determining
whether a transition is at the begin or end of a section or the document.
