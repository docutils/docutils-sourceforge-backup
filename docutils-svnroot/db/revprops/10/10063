LaTeX writer: Fix formatting of "authors" bibinfo field.

Collect author names from "author" fields nested in "authors".

With "--use-docutils-docinfo", use one "authors" entry instead of separate
"author" entries for the individual author names.

With "--use-latex-docinfo", print author names as one block
to ensure a common author affiliation is centered under all
author names, not just the last (cf. https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/11656/288060).
