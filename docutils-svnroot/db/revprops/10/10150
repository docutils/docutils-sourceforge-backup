manpage writer: do not drop text content of inline targets.

Inline targets are eponymous, they point to a text portion that is
also the base of the target's name and id.

Generated manpages do not implement internal hyperlinks but the
document source may be used with different writers and contain
cross references -> print the text as normal text.
