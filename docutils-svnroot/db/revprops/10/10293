Fix :number-lines: option of the "include" directive.

Fix Sphinx issue #14261: ":number-lines: 0 for includes does not work correctly".

Commit [r9909] changed the conversion function to return "None" or an integer.
The former simple test for an optional start value failed for value 0,
because bool("0") == True but bool(0) == False.

Use the conversion function `value_or((None,), int)` also in the Code directive.
END
