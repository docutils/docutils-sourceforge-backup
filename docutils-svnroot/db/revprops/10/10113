Documentation fixes and update.

alternatives.rst:
  * "standard definition files" are now included as part of Docutils.
  * the "dfn" role (defined in the "html-roles.txt" standard definition file
    corresponds to the HTML `<dfn>` element for the defining term.
    It can be used instead of a simple emphasis for a more semantic markup.

todo.rst:
  * tools/buildhtml.py has now an "--ignore" option for files,
  * "container" directive now reports an error if the :class: option is used
    (classes are passed as argument),
  * definition list line numbers are fixed,
  * `frontend.filter_settings_spec` is not suited to filter command line options
    that don't apply,
  * the `--section-numbering` command line option is implemented,
  * front-end tools will accept more than one source document in Docutils 2.0
    (see RELEASE-NOTES).
