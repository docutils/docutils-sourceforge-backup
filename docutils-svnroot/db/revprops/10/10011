Fixes for metadata in LaTeX and ODT.

Just like the HTML writer, LaTeX and ODT writers now use
the `<document>` element's "title" attribute (the "metadata title",
https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/ref/doctree.html#title-1)
instead of its `<title>` element in the document metadata.

LaTeX writer:
Encode special characters in the content of the "meta" directive.
Fix "hyperef" keys for "creator" and "producer".

TODO:
Filter nodes with additional fields ("lang", "http-equiv", …)?
They are HTML-specific and may override equally named keys.
Only if name already present?
END
