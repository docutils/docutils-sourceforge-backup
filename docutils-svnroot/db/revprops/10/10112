The new file "html-roles.txt" provides role definitions for

"tags for representation of edits to the document".

The additional roles "b", "bdi", "del", "dfn", "i", "ins",
"kbd", "mark", "q", "samp", "small", "u", "s", and "var"
work out of the box with the "html5" writer.
LaTeX styling definitions are inlcuded.
