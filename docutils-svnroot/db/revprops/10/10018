HTML5 writer: docinfo styling tweaks

"minimal.css":
  make docinfo list compact (no top/bottom margin around fields).

"responsive.css":
  Use standard "wide" indentation (left margin) in "docinfo" fields
  to get better alignment, especially of multiple authors in "authors" field.
  Use a smaller indentation for narrow screens.

  Remove spurious selector: option-lists don't use the "--field-indent" variable.
END
