LaTeX writer: don't write labels for implicit IDs that are not referenced.

With LaTeX-generated PDFs, there is no (easy) way to link to a fragment from
an external source. Therefore, we only need `\label` macros for IDs that actually
are either from an explicit target (or a directive with "name" option) or
referenced to from the current document (internal cross-links).

This drops most labels from section titles, making the TeX file less verbose
and faster to compile.
