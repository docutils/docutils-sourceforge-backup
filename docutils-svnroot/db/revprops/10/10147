LaTeX writer: Use a transform to resolve BibTeX references.

The 'use_bibtex' setting indicates that citation entries are fetched
from a BibTeX database by the backend (LaTeX).
Use a transfrom instead of the deprecated "unknown_reference_resolvers"
hook chain to mark citation_references as resolved.
