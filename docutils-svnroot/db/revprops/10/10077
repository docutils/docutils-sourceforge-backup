Use `PendingDeprecationWarning` and postpone removal when replacement is in 0.22.

Adam Turner noted DeprecationWarnings for some features where the replacement
functionality is introduced in Docutils 0.22.
As backwards compatibility with 0.21 should not imply DeprecationWarnings,
this commit postpones the removal to Docutils 2.0 and changes the
DeprecationWarnings to PendingDeprecationWarnings.
END
