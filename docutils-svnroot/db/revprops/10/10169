Add alias "rst-class" for the "class" directive.

Improves the compatibility with Sphinx which overwrites the "class" directive
with "domain specific" directives (by default  "py:class").

The alias is added to the English-language mappings for directive names
(similar to "section-numbering") so that missing translations don't lead
failures. As English names are used as fallback, the alias works independent
of the document language.
