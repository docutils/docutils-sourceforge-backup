Made pysource compliant with current API changes
Wrote "rjhack", my attempt to bring the pysource sandbox further into line
with the current API. It works for one module, and extending it for
packages looks reasonable with modifications to the Reader class. I think.
Post-parse formatting of ReST docstrings (using '__docformat__ = "reST"')
barfs in interesting ways ;)
Had to tweak the existing pysource API in a couple of ways, but they seemed
sane enough to me...
