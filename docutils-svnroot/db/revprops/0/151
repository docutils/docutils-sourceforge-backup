- Moved ``utils.id()`` to ``nodes.make_id()`` to avoid circular  imports.- Added support for an option values object which carries default  settings and overrides (from command-line options and library use).- Cleaned up imports: no more relative package imports or  comma-separated lists of top-level modules.
