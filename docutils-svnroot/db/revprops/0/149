- Removed many keyword parameters to ``Publisher.__init__()`` and  ``publish()``; bundled into an option values object.  Added  ``argv`` and ``usage`` parameters for command-line support.- Added ``Publisher.process_command_line()`` and ``.set_options()``  methods.- Added support for an option values object which carries default  settings and overrides (from command-line options and library use).- Cleaned up imports: no more relative package imports or  comma-separated lists of top-level modules.
