apply patch (SF 2794502): Allow stdin input interpretation and stdout output generation

Comment from Leandro Lucarella who provided the patch:

This patch changes the command-line interface to work in a one-file
oriented way, to allow to process input via stdin and to write output to
stdout. This allows piping in a more *nix way.

A new command-line option is added to specify the name of the output
file (-o/--output). When omitted, the output is written to stdout. Same
goes to the input file, if none is specified, the input is taken from
stdin.

As a trade-off, multiple file processing is not supported anymore. This
shouldn't be bad, as you can always use your favorite shell's looping
capabilities to generate a bunch of files with one command.

END
