Fixes and updates -- page size, new visitor methods, nested lists, etc.

Added support for the meta directive.  See docs.
Added support for additional visit_/depart_ methods.
Regularized some of the methods that generated fields: revision,
version, date, address, contact, copyright, organization, etc.
Added more control for control of paper size, thanks to Michael
Schutte:
1. __init__.py attempts to run paperconf.  If paperconf succeeds
   and if the styles.odt file does not contain paper size, the size
   is inserted into the styles.xml in the generated document.
2. Added rst2odt_prepstyles.py script -- Drop page size
   specifications from styles.xml in STYLE_FILE.odt.
Added tools/rst2odt_prepstyles.py to the distribution.
