Added admonitions and rubric; fixed import of ElementTree and Directives

Added:

- Added support for admonitions.  Both specific admonitions and
  generic admonition are supported.  There are specific styles for
  the header and the body of each admonition (see doc).

- Added support for the rubric directive.  There is a specific
  style for the rubric, but you can also specific a style by using
  the "class" option on the rubric directive.  (see doc)

Fixes:

- Fixed error produced when odtwriter is used with a version of
  Docutils that does not implement the Directive class.
  (docutils.parsers.rst.Directive).

- If you have Python 2.5, you should now be able to use odtwriter
  without installing either Lxml or ElementTree.  ElementTree is in
  the standard library in Python 2.5, but odtwriter was not looking
  for it there.  Now, it does.
