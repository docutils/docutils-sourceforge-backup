failsave implementation of custom roles in latex2e

The latex2e writer currently translates <inline> nodes with a class
argument (e.g. produced by a custom role or the upcoming
syntax-highlighting souce-code directive) to specific LaTeX macros,
which allows a style sheet to define this macro but leaves the document
uncompilable without a special style sheet.

The patch below lets the latex2ewriter produce code that

1.  compiles without error ignoring the unknown classes

2.  allows styling of the marked-up code in a custom stylesheet

END
