* Added a "target" role that allows separation of inline target tags
  from the text that is displayed.
* Fixed a bug where, if two items in an enumerated list occurred with
  no blank line between them and a third item was separated by a blank
  line, the third item was put into a separate list.
* Fixed the handling of DOM items that were in a subclass of DOM.
* Added an argument to the role attribute and role text routines which
  is the name of the role.
