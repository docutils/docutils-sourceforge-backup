Various additions and fixes, including:

- Added support for epigraph and the associated attribution.  Added
  and fixed styles for epigraph, attribution, and block-quote.

- Added support for line-block.  Added style for line blocks.

- Added support for substitution (replace directive).  Actually, the
  substitution is done before odtwriter starts walking the tree.
  But, I added the visit/depart methods so as to eliminate the error
  messages.

- Fixed visit_Text so that it can add *multiple* text nodes that are
  all children of the same node.
