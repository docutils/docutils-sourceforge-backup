push system messages up to super-document so they do not get lost (tested);
expand ~ in docset-root and subdocs (not tested);
prune subdocs for a couple of target/reference transforms which are applied to every document anyway, so they do not need to descend into subdocs (not all tested);
removed unnecessary import in latex2e
