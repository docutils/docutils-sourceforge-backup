Some elements which may not be doubled by a replacement because they
must be single by definition propagate a replacement up if their
siblings also could propagate a replacement up. This way for instance
sections which are complete replacements are recognized and marked up
properly.

Added README and man page `rstdiff.pod`.

Upgraded tests to filterunit V0.7.1.

Adapted expected test output to Docutils 0.8.
