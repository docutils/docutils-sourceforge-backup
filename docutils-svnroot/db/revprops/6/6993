* Package version

  There is a package version in `rst-version`. For a release it's only
  the official version number, for development version in addition it
  contains the revision and timestamp.

  The package version is used for customizable variables according to
  Emacs standards.

* Indentation and filling

  Indentation and filling is completely revised / new. The general
  idea is to determine tabs which make sense for reStructuredText and
  use them for indentation and filling.

  Like in other modes <tab> always indents the current line. If the
  current indentation is irregular the most likely tab for continuing
  the last block is used. If the indentation matches a tab already the
  indentation for the next tab in the list of possible tabs is used.

  The customization group `rst-indent` contains a couple of
  customizable variables to match different styles.

  Auto-fill uses these mechanism, too.

  Filling also uses these mechanisms. For most types of
  reStructuredText blocks <M-q> (`fill-paragraph`) does what you
  expect including filling of regions.

  These features should improve the experience of editing
  reStructuredText in Emacs much. Feedback on these features is
  welcome.

* Improved paragraph recognition

  Most reStructuredText blocks are now recognized as paragraphs. Thus
  things like <C-down> (`forward-paragraph`) and friends work. This
  also influences filling.

* Comment handling

  Comment handling is revised / new. <M-#> (`comment-region`) works
  and comments are treated correctly in filling.

  At the moment only one style for commenting regions is supported.
  Feedback on this feature is welcome.

* Deprecated commands

  The following commands had never been bound to keys. It seems
  unlikely that they are used and for this reason they are deprecated
  starting with this release:

  * `rst-replace-lines`

  * `rst-join-paragraph`

  * `rst-force-fill-paragraph`

  * `rst-repeat-last-character`

  Feedback whether they are really used by someone is welcome.
  Otherwise they are removed at some point.

* New customizable variables

  A couple of variables defined by `defvar` so far are now
  customizable:

  * `rst-adjust-hook`

  * `rst-new-adornment-down`

  * `rst-preferred-bullets`

* New tests

  Lots of tests have been added.
