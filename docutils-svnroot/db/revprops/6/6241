* Allow a stylesheet mechanism for styling classes of inline
  elements.  For example, if you define a custom role ``myrole``, then
  text using that role will appear with ``\styleinlinemyrole(...)``
  around it.  There will be a null definition for the style which can
  be overridden using ``\renewcommand{\styleinlinemyrole}{1}{#1}``.
* Fixed parsed literals to be more literal than they were (e.g., don't
  convert ``<=`` to a less-than-or-equal sign.)
* Handle blank lines within parsed literals
* Fixed the newlines around ``\item`` and ``\end{description}``
* Fixed a bug where a comment could cause some actual text to
  disappear because it didn't end with a newline
* Added support for superscript and custom roles
* Added support for a figure's class to be used as the name of the
  latex environment
* Added support for mathml labels
