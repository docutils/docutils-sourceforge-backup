Made the fault grading try a straight diff first, and automatically do
a regular-expression diff if the straight diff fails.  This
methodology no longer requires an empty ".r" file to indicate that a
regular-expression diff is needed.  The rediff was only needed on some
systems, so requiring the ".r" files was error-prone.
