Functional changes
==================

* `rst-insert-list` inserts new list or continues existing lists

  * Based on code by Wei-Wei Guo

* Revised key bindings

  * Rebound nearly all bindings to make room in the keymap for further
    extensions and to bind them to the same keys as in other modes

  * New key bindings use a two step approach

  * Old bindings are still present but deprecated

  * Bindings are described with ^H

* Improvements in regular expressions

  * `comment-start-skip` cares about indendation relative to explicit
    markup tag so such comments are filled properly

  * Shift region works with all kinds of valid item types

  * Paragraph starts recognize list item types and no longer allows
    ">" prefixes

* Other improvements

  * Bullets are no longer customizable and contain all bullets
    supported by reST

  * `rst-toc-update` sets point correctly

  * `rst-bullet-list-region` uses `rst-preferred-bullets`

Refactorings
============

* Regular expressions are handled by own infrastructure so they become
  much more comprehensible

* Revised tests

  * Introduced `ert` as a test framework

  * Added support for `ert` based tests

  * Refactored existing tests to use `ert`

  * Added tests for regular expression refactoring

  * Added tests for inserting items

  * Added tests for toc insertion

* Improved structure of some functions

* Replaced "decoration" and derivatives to "adornment" so the wording
  is now the same everywhere

* Made a couple of reST structures explicit in `defconst`\s

* Removed Emacs backward compatibility code

* Added `IDEAS.rst`
