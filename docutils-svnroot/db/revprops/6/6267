Copy/convert test suite and tools with ``python3 setup.py build``.

With Python 3, the "build" command copies test/ and tools/ to the
build-dir and auto-converts Python sources with 2to3.
These directories provied developer tools (like buildhtml.py) and the
test suite. They are not installed with "install".
