Improvements in fontification:

* Comments are always fontified correctly
* Line blocks are supported
* `jit-lock-mode` is still not usable
* `rst-font-lock-extend-region` is used as suggested by main Emacs
  developers but needs compilation

Refactorings:

* Replaced some occurences of `current-prefix-arg'
* Removed dead code
* Modified `tests-runner.el` to work as a filter, too
